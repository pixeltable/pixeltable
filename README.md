Pixeltable is a Python library that lets AI engineers and data scientists focus on exploration, modeling, and app development without dealing with the customary data plumbing.

## What problems does Pixeltable solve?

Todayâ€™s solutions for AI app development require extensive custom coding and infrastructure
plumbing. Tracking lineage and versions between and across data transformations, models, and
deployment is cumbersome. Pixeltable is a replacement for traditional data plumbing, providing
a unified plane for data, models, and orchestration. It removes the data plumbing overhead in
building and productionizing AI applications.

## âš¡Quick Start
Learn the basics of Pixeltable through interactive examples. View the notebooks on Google Colab or Kaggle, for free.

### Pixeltable Basics
In this tutorial, we'll survey how to create tables, populate them with data, and enhance them with built-in and user-defined transformations and AI operations.

## ðŸ’¾ Installation
Pixeltable works with Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 running on Linux, MacOS, or Windows.

```
pip install pixeltable
```

To verify that it's working:

```
import pixeltable as pxt
cl = pxt.Client()
```

For more detailed installation instructions, see the
[Getting Started with Pixeltable](https://pixeltable.github.io/pixeltable/getting-started/)
guide. Then, check out the
[Pixeltable Basics](https://pixeltable.github.io/pixeltable/tutorials/pixeltable-basics/)
tutorial for a tour of its most important features.

## Why should you use Pixeltable?

- It gives you transparency and reproducibility
    - All generated data is automatically recorded and versioned
    - You will never need to re-run a workload because you lost track of the input data
- It saves you money
    - All data changes are automatically incremental
    - You never need to re-run pipelines from scratch because youâ€™re adding data
- It integrates with any existing Python code or libraries
    - Bring your ever-changing code and workloads
    - You choose the models, tools, and AI practices (e.g., your embedding model for a vector index); Pixeltable orchestrates the data

## Example Use Cases

* Interact with video data at the frame level without having to think about frame extraction,
intermediate file storage, or storage space explosion.
* Augment your data incrementally and interactively with built-in functions and UDFs, such as
image transformations, model inference, and visualizations, without having to think about data pipelines,
incremental updates, or capturing function output.
* Interact with all the data relevant to your AI application (video, images, documents, audio, structured data, JSON) through
a simple dataframe-style API directly in Python. This includes:
    * similarity search on embeddings, supported by high-dimensional vector indexing
    * path expressions and transformations on JSON data
    * PIL and OpenCV image operations
    * assembling frames into videos
* Perform keyword and image similarity search at the video frame level without having to worry about frame
storage.
* Access all Pixeltable-resident data directly as a PyTorch dataset in your training scripts.
* Understand the compute and storage costs of your data at the granularity of individual augmentations and
get cost projections before adding new data and new augmentations.
* Rely on Pixeltable's automatic versioning and snapshot functionality to protect against regressions
and to ensure reproducibility.

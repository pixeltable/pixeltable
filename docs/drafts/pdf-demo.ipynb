DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and benefit a broad\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\nHowever, there are several practical difficulties for taking advantages of re-\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the final outputs. Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest significant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel.\\nLayoutParser provides a unified toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing.

       "      <td>Recently, various DL models and datasets have been developed for layout analysis\\ntasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-\\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\\nbeen used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no unified framework to load and use such models.\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data.

## Publish & Replicate ✅ Available Now

| Feature | API |
|---------|-----|
| Publish datasets | [`pxt.publish(source, destination_uri)`](/platform/data-sharing) |
| Replicate datasets | [`pxt.replicate(remote_uri, local_path)`](/platform/data-sharing) |
| Sync updates | `push()`, `pull()` |
| Access control | `access='public'` or `'private'` |

```python
# Publish your curated dataset
pxt.publish(source='my-table', destination_uri='pxt://myorg/my-dataset')

# Anyone can replicate public datasets (no account required)
coco = pxt.replicate(remote_uri='pxt://pixeltable:fiftyone/coco_mini_2017', local_path='coco-copy')
```

## Unified: Where It's All Going

When all three cloud services are available, the two use cases converge:

- **Data wrangling + AI pipelines + endpoints = one system**
- **Orchestration + storage + retrieval unified**
- **Table becomes the endpoint**

Your training datasets and production APIs share the same infrastructure—versioning, lineage, and retrieval in the serving path.

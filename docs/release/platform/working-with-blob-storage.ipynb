        "# Working with Blob Storage in Pixeltable\n",
        "\n",
        "Pixeltable manages metadata, transformations, and workflows for your multimodal AI applications, while your actual media files (images, videos, audio) are stored in cloud blob storage services like S3, R2, B2, Azure Blob, GCS, or Tigris.\n",
        "\n",
        "This guide shows you how to configure Pixeltable to automatically store your media files in blob storage and retrieve servable URLs for serving to browsers and applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What you'll learn\n",
        "\n",
        "- How Pixeltable resolves where to store media files (destination precedence).\n",
        "- How to store media files you insert into tables.\n",
        "- How to store media files that Pixeltable generates (computed columns).\n",
        "- How to get servable URLs for all your media files.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why use blob storage\n",
        "\n",
        "Pixeltable generates a lot of media files. When you create computed columns that process images, videos, or audio, each transformation creates new files. This can quickly consume your local storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Storage constraints.** You may not have enough local disk space to handle all the media files Pixeltable generates.\n",
        "- **Integration needs.** You need to serve these files to downstream applications, browsers, or APIs — blob storage provides direct, queryable URLs.\n",
        "- **Scalability.** As your data grows, local storage becomes impractical.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example scenario: \"I don't have a lot of space on my machine. Anything I do in Pixeltable, please store in blob storage so I can access it from anywhere and serve it to my applications.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "By configuring blob storage destinations, you can:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Offload storage.** Store all generated media in cloud blob storage instead of local disk.\n",
        "- **Get servable URLs.** Query URLs that point directly to your files for serving to browsers and applications.\n",
        "- **Integrate seamlessly.** Works with services like [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/building-multimodal-ai-data-infrastructure-with-pixeltable/), [Tigris](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/quickstarts/pixeltable/), and Google Cloud Storage.\n",

        "## How destinations are resolved\n",
        "\n",
        "Before diving into configuration, it's essential to understand how Pixeltable resolves where to store media files. Pixeltable uses a **precedence hierarchy** to resolve the destination.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Destination precedence (trumping order):**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Explicit column destination** — Trumps everything else (computed columns only).\n",
        "   - When you specify `destination=` parameter in `add_computed_column()`, that destination is **always used**.\n",
        "   - Example: `t.add_computed_column(thumbnail=t.image.resize((100, 100)), destination='s3://bucket/thumbnails/')`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Global default** — Used if no explicit destination is specified.\n",
        "   - For **input columns** (media you insert): Uses `input_media_dest` from config if set.\n",
        "   - For **computed columns** (media Pixeltable generates): Uses `output_media_dest` from config if set.\n",
        "   - Only applies when no explicit column destination is specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Local storage** — Fallback if nothing else is configured.\n",
        "   - If no explicit destination and no global default is configured, files are stored in Pixeltable's local storage.\n",
        "   - This is the default behavior when no blob storage destinations are configured.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Trumping rules:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Explicit column destinations **always trump** global defaults.\n",
        "- Global defaults only apply when no explicit destination is specified.\n",
        "- Input columns can only use global `input_media_dest` (they don't support per-column destinations).\n",

        "One of the key benefits of storing media in blob storage is that you can serve files directly to browsers and applications. Pixeltable provides queryable URLs through the `.fileurl` property that point to your files in blob storage.\n",

        "\n",
        "Query URLs using `.fileurl` in your select statements:\n",

        "# Query media with their blob storage URLs\n",
        "t.select(\n",
        "    t.source_image,\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Destination precedence.** Explicit column destinations trump global defaults, which trump local storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Input vs output.** Input columns (what you insert) can only use global `input_media_dest`. Computed columns (what Pixeltable generates) can use either explicit `destination=` parameter or global `output_media_dest`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Pixeltable manages metadata.** Pixeltable manages metadata and workflows; blob storage holds the actual media files. This is an integrated system, not just storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Servable URLs.** Regardless of how your media is stored, you can query URLs using `.fileurl` that point directly to your files in blob storage.\n",

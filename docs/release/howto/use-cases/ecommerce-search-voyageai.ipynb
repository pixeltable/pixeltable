        "- **DataFrame Import**: Load data directly from pandas with automatic type mapping\n",
        "- **Multi-Column Embedding Indexes**: Separate indexes for product name, category, and description\n",
        "- **Weighted Search**: Combine similarity scores with custom weights per column\n",
        "- **Image Handling**: Use `schema_overrides` to type URL columns as images automatically\n",
        "- **Query Functions**: Reusable retrieval logic for complex pipelines\n",
        "\n",
        "### Voyage AI Features\n",
        "- **voyage-3.5**: Best-in-class embedding model for retrieval tasks\n",

## Working with LLMs

You can use large language models (LLMs) to assist in building Pixeltable integrations. We provide a set of tools and best practices if you use LLMs during development.

## Plain text docs

You can access all of our documentation as plain text markdown files by adding `.md` to the end of any url. For example, you can find the plain text version of this page itself at [https://docs.pixeltable.com/overview/building-pixeltable-with-llms.md](https://docs.pixeltable.com/overview/building-pixeltable-with-llms.md).

This helps AI tools and agents consume our content and allows you to copy and paste the entire contents of a doc into an LLM. This format is preferable to scraping or copying from our HTML and JavaScript-rendered pages because:

* Plain text contains fewer formatting tokens.
* Content that isn't rendered in the default view (for example, it's hidden in a tab) of a given page is rendered in the plain text version.
* LLMs can parse and understand markdown hierarchy.

We host two files to assist AI tools and agents:

1. [https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms.txt](https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms.txt): This file instructs how to retrieve plain text versions of our pages. It follows the [emerging standard](https://llmstxt.org/) for making websites and content more accessible to LLMs.

2. [https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms-full.txt](https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms-full.txt): This file contains more comprehensive instructions and metadata about our documentation structure.

These files help AI tools navigate and understand our documentation more effectively.

## Hosted MCP server

We provide a hosted MCP server that AI applications can connect to directly for searching our documentation.

**MCP Server URL:**
```
https://docs.pixeltable.com/mcp
```

**Available Tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SearchPixeltableDocumentation` | Search across the Pixeltable documentation to find relevant information, code examples, API references, and guides. Returns contextual content with titles and direct links. |

<Tip>
Use this URL to connect AI applications like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf to our documentation.

## Self-hosted MCP server

For developers who want more control or need to call the Pixeltable API directly, we provide a self-hosted [Pixeltable MCP server](/libraries/mcp). This server provides AI agents tools for calling the Pixeltable API and searching our knowledge base.

## Vibe Coding with Pixeltable

Pixeltable's declarative primitives make it ideal for LLM-assisted development. Instead of writing complex orchestration code, you describe *what* you want—and LLMs can generate correct Pixeltable code on the first try.

```python
# LLMs can easily generate this pattern
import pixeltable as pxt
from pixeltable.functions.huggingface import sentence_transformer

t = pxt.create_table('myapp.docs', {'text': pxt.String}, if_exists='ignore')
t.add_embedding_index('text', embedding=sentence_transformer.using(model_id='all-MiniLM-L6-v2'))
```

## Agent Instructions Files

We provide instruction files for AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.) to understand the Pixeltable codebase:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AGENTS.md" icon="file-code" href="https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/blob/main/AGENTS.md">
    Instructions for AI agents: project structure, conventions, and patterns
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLAUDE.md" icon="file-code" href="https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/blob/main/CLAUDE.md">
    Claude-specific agent instructions (same content as AGENTS.md)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Add these to your project or point your AI assistant to them for better Pixeltable code generation.

## Plain text docs

You can access all of our documentation as plain text markdown files by adding `.md` to the end of any url. For example, you can find the plain text version of this page itself at [https://docs.pixeltable.com/overview/building-pixeltable-with-llms.md](https://docs.pixeltable.com/overview/building-pixeltable-with-llms.md).

This helps AI tools and agents consume our content and allows you to copy and paste the entire contents of a doc into an LLM. This format is preferable to scraping or copying from our HTML and JavaScript-rendered pages because:

* Plain text contains fewer formatting tokens.
* Content that isn't rendered in the default view (for example, it's hidden in a tab) of a given page is rendered in the plain text version.
* LLMs can parse and understand markdown hierarchy.

We host two files to assist AI tools and agents:

1. [https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms.txt](https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms.txt): This file instructs how to retrieve plain text versions of our pages. It follows the [emerging standard](https://llmstxt.org/) for making websites and content more accessible to LLMs.

2. [https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms-full.txt](https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms-full.txt): This file contains more comprehensive instructions and metadata about our documentation structure.

These files help AI tools navigate and understand our documentation more effectively.

## Hosted MCP server

We provide a hosted MCP server that AI applications can connect to directly for searching our documentation.

**MCP Server URL:**
```
https://docs.pixeltable.com/mcp
```

**Available Tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SearchPixeltableDocumentation` | Search across the Pixeltable documentation to find relevant information, code examples, API references, and guides. Returns contextual content with titles and direct links. |

<Tip>
Use this URL to connect AI applications like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf to our documentation.
</Tip>

## Self-hosted MCP server

For developers who want more control or need to call the Pixeltable API directly, we provide a self-hosted [Pixeltable MCP server](/libraries/mcp). This server provides AI agents tools for calling the Pixeltable API and searching our knowledge base.

<Card title="Pixeltable MCP servers" icon="github" href="https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable-mcp-server">
  View the source code and contribute to our Pixeltable MCP servers
</Card>

The self-hosted server gives agents direct access to Pixeltable's multimodal capabilities:
- **Audio:** Transcription, speaker diarization, audio search
- **Video:** Frame extraction, scene detection, object tracking
- **Images:** Object detection, classification, similarity search
- **Text:** RAG retrieval, document parsing, semantic search

## Pixelagent Toolkit

If you're building agentic software, we provide an SDK for adding Pixeltable functionality to your agent's capabilities.

<Card title="Pixelagent" icon="github" href="https://github.com/pixeltable/pixelagent">
  Agent engineering blueprint powered on Pixeltable
</Card>

Pixelagent provides:
- **Multi-agent systems:** Coordinate multiple agents with shared memory
- **Tool calling:** Register UDFs and queries as callable tools
- **State management:** Automatic persistence of conversation history
- **Observability:** Full lineage tracking of agent decisions

Learn more in our [Pixelagent documentation](/libraries/pixelagent).

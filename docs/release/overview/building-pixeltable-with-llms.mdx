## Working with LLMs

You can use large language models (LLMs) to assist in building Pixeltable integrations. We provide a set of tools and best practices if you use LLMs during development.

## Plain text docs

You can access all of our documentation as plain text markdown files by adding `.md` to the end of any url. For example, you can find the plain text version of this page itself at [https://docs.pixeltable.com/overview/building-pixeltable-with-llms.md](https://docs.pixeltable.com/overview/building-pixeltable-with-llms.md).

This helps AI tools and agents consume our content and allows you to copy and paste the entire contents of a doc into an LLM. This format is preferable to scraping or copying from our HTML and JavaScript-rendered pages because:

* Plain text contains fewer formatting tokens.
* Content that isn't rendered in the default view (for example, it's hidden in a tab) of a given page is rendered in the plain text version.
* LLMs can parse and understand markdown hierarchy.

We host two files to assist AI tools and agents:

1. [https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms.txt](https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms.txt): This file instructs how to retrieve plain text versions of our pages. It follows the [emerging standard](https://llmstxt.org/) for making websites and content more accessible to LLMs.

2. [https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms-full.txt](https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms-full.txt): This file contains more comprehensive instructions and metadata about our documentation structure.

These files help AI tools navigate and understand our documentation more effectively.

## Hosted MCP server

We provide a hosted MCP server that AI applications can connect to directly for searching our documentation.

**MCP Server URL:**
```
https://docs.pixeltable.com/mcp
```

**Available Tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SearchPixeltableDocumentation` | Search across the Pixeltable documentation to find relevant information, code examples, API references, and guides. Returns contextual content with titles and direct links. |

<Tip>
Use this URL to connect AI applications like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf to our documentation.
</Tip>

## Self-hosted MCP server

For developers who want more control or need to call the Pixeltable API directly, we provide a self-hosted [Pixeltable MCP server](/libraries/mcp). This server provides AI agents tools for calling the Pixeltable API and searching our knowledge base.

<Card title="Pixeltable MCP servers" icon="github" href="https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable-mcp-server">
  View the source code and contribute to our Pixeltable MCP servers
</Card>

The self-hosted server gives agents direct access to Pixeltable's multimodal capabilities:
- **Audio:** Transcription, speaker diarization, audio search
- **Video:** Frame extraction, scene detection, object tracking
- **Images:** Object detection, classification, similarity search
- **Text:** RAG retrieval, document parsing, semantic search

## Pixelagent Toolkit

If you're building agentic software, we provide an SDK for adding Pixeltable functionality to your agent's capabilities.

<Card title="Pixelagent" icon="github" href="https://github.com/pixeltable/pixelagent">
  Agent engineering blueprint powered on Pixeltable
</Card>

Pixelagent provides:
- **Multi-agent systems:** Coordinate multiple agents with shared memory
- **Tool calling:** Register UDFs and queries as callable tools
- **State management:** Automatic persistence of conversation history
- **Observability:** Full lineage tracking of agent decisions

Learn more in our [Pixelagent documentation](/libraries/pixelagent).

## Building Agents with Pixeltable

<Tip>
**Declarative Agents:** Instead of imperative control flow, define your agent as a table with computed columns. Each row is a user query; computed columns define the reasoning chain (tool selection → execution → context retrieval → response). Pixeltable handles orchestration, caching, and persistence automatically.
</Tip>

```python
import pixeltable as pxt
from pixeltable.functions.openai import chat_completions

# Define tools
@pxt.udf
def search_docs(query: str) -> str:
    """Search internal documentation."""
    results = docs.text.similarity(query).order_by(asc=False).limit(5).collect()
    return "\n".join(r['text'] for r in results)

# Create agent table
agent = pxt.create_table('myapp.agent', {'user_query': pxt.String})

# Define reasoning chain as computed columns
agent.add_computed_column(
    context=search_docs(agent.user_query)
)
agent.add_computed_column(
    response=chat_completions(
        messages=[
            {'role': 'system', 'content': 'Answer using the context provided.'},
            {'role': 'user', 'content': agent.user_query + '\n\nContext: ' + agent.context}
        ],
        model='gpt-4o-mini'
    )
)
```

In the [Pixeltable Basics](https://pixeltable.github.io/pixeltable/tutorials/pixeltable-basics/) tutorial, we saw how OpenAI API calls can be incorporated into Pixeltable workflows. In this tutorial, we'll go into more depth on OpenAI integration. You'll need an OpenAI API key to run this demo.\n",

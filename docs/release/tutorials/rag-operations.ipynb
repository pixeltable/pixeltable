    "# RAG Operations in Pixeltable\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore Pixeltable's flexible handling of RAG operations on unstructured text. In a traditional AI workflow, such operations might be implemented as a Python script that runs on a periodic schedule or in response to certain events. In Pixeltable, as with everything else, they are implemented as persistent table operations that update incrementally as new data becomes available. In our tutorial workflow, we'll chunk Wikipedia articles in various ways with a document splitter, then apply several kinds of embeddings to the chunks.\n",

    "We start by installing the necessary dependencies, creating a Pixeltable directory `rag_ops_demo` (if it doesn't already exist), and setting up the table structure for our new workflow."

At the age of 13, his mother tried to enrol him in a regular high school, and he recalled: &quot;But in that school, they don&#x27;t take Jews.

    "This is a good time to mention another important guiding principle of Pixeltable. The preceding examples all used the built-in `DocumentSplitter` class with various configurations. That's probably fine as a first cut or to prototype an application quickly, and it might be sufficient for some applications. But other applications might want to do more sophisticated kinds of chunking, implementing their own specialized logic or leveraging third-party tools. Pixeltable imposes no constraints on the AI or RAG operations a workflow uses: the iterator interface is highly general, and it's easy to implement new operations or adapt existing code or third-party tools into the Pixeltable workflow."

To compute our embeddings, we'll use the Huggingface `sentence_transformer` package, running it over the `chunks` view that broke our documents up into larger paragraphs. Pixeltable has a built-in `sentence_transformer` adapter, and all we have to do is add a new column that leverages it. Pixeltable takes care of the rest, applying the new column to all existing data in the view."

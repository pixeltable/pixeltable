In the [Pixeltable Basics](https://pixeltable.github.io/pixeltable/tutorials/pixeltable-basics/) tutorial, we saw how OpenAI API calls can be incorporated into Pixeltable workflows. In this tutorial, we'll go into more depth on OpenAI integration. You'll need an OpenAI API key to run this demo.\n",

    "The same day, the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America was announced.[19] The beginning of the week was marked by extreme instability in global stock markets, with dramatic drops in market values on Monday, September 15, and Wednesday, September 17.\n",

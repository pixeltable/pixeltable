## How They Relate

Both use cases leverage the same core Pixeltable capabilities:

| Capability | ML Data Wrangling | AI Applications |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Multimodal Types** | ✅ Video, Audio, Image, Document | ✅ Video, Audio, Image, Document |
| **Computed Columns** | ✅ Enrichment & pre-annotation | ✅ Pipeline orchestration |
| **Embedding Indexes** | ✅ Curation & similarity search | ✅ RAG & retrieval |
| **Versioning** | ✅ Dataset snapshots | ✅ Data lineage |
| **Data Sharing** | ✅ Publish datasets | ✅ Team collaboration |

## When They Converge

With [Pixeltable Cloud Services](/cloud/get-started), both workflows unify:

- **Data wrangling + AI pipelines + endpoints = one system**
- **Orchestration + storage + retrieval unified**
- **Table becomes the endpoint**

Your training datasets and production APIs share the same infrastructure—versioning, lineage, and retrieval in the serving path.

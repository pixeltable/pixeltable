 Allow me to illustrate. During the last 60 days, I have been at the task of constructing an administration. It has been a long and deliberate process. Some have come from Seoul, great speed. Others have counseled more expedient tests. But I have been guided by the standard. John Winthrop set before his shipmates on the flagship Arab Bella, 331 years ago, as they too faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier. We must always consider you said that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. Today, the eyes of all people are truly upon us. And our governments in every branch, at every level.

## Overview

Build and share multimodal AI datasets without managing infrastructure. Work with your images, videos, audio, and documents through a unified Python API - process them with AI models, create embeddings, and publish your results for team collaboration or public research.

## Replicate Public Datasets

Use the open-source Pixeltable SDK to replicate public datasets - no account required:

```bash
pip install pixeltable
```

```python
import pixeltable as pxt

# Replicate a public dataset to your local environment
local_table = pxt.replicate(
    'pxt://org_name/project/dataset',
    'my_project.local_copy'
)
```

Learn more in the [SDK Reference](https://docs.pixeltable.com/sdk/latest/).

## Publish Your Datasets

To publish your own datasets to Pixeltable Cloud:

1. **Create a Pixeltable account** at [signin.pixeltable.com](https://signin.pixeltable.com/)
2. **Get your API key** from your account dashboard
3. **Follow the complete publishing guide** in Pixeltable Cloud

Once published, you can share your datasets publicly or privately with your team.

## Overview

This section covers all of Pixeltable's native integrations, organized by category:

## Cloud LLM Providers
Access the latest language models from leading cloud providers with unified APIs and automatic optimization.

## Local LLM Runtimes  
Run open-source models locally with high-performance runtimes for privacy and cost control.

## Model Hubs
Connect to vast libraries of pre-trained models for specialized tasks across domains.

## Computer Vision & Audio
Leverage state-of-the-art models for image analysis, object detection, and audio processing.

## Annotation & Data Tools
Integrate with professional annotation platforms and data management tools.

## Custom Integrations
Build your own integrations with custom embedding models and specialized workflows.

## Getting Started

Each integration is designed to work seamlessly with Pixeltable's declarative approach. Simply import the integration and use it in computed columns for automatic processing of your data.

```python
import pixeltable as pxt
from pixeltable.functions import openai

# Create table with built-in integration
t = pxt.create_table('content', {'text': pxt.String})
t.add_computed_column(
    summary=openai.chat_completions(
        model='gpt-4', 
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': f'Summarize: {t.text}'}]
    )
)
```

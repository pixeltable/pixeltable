# Understanding Pixeltable

Pixeltable is declarative data infrastructure for multimodal AI apps where tables store not just data, but workflows.

## What makes Pixeltable different?

Unlike traditional databases that store static data, Pixeltable tables store workflows. When you add a computed column, you're not just defining a transformationâ€”you're creating a persistent, versioned workflow that automatically processes new data as it arrives.

```python
import pixeltable as pxt

# Create a table that stores workflows, not just data
t = pxt.create_table('videos', {'video': pxt.Video})

# Add AI analysis as computed columns - these are workflows
t.add_computed_column(
    transcription=whisper.transcribe(t.video)
)
t.add_computed_column(
    summary=openai.chat_completions(
        model='gpt-4',
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': f'Summarize: {t.transcription}'}]
    )
)

# Insert data - all workflows execute automatically
t.insert([{'video': 'meeting.mp4'}])
```

Every time you insert a new video, both the transcription and summary are computed automatically. You never have a moment where the transcription is from an old version while the summary is from a new version.

## The Architecture

Pixeltable consists of several key layers that work together to provide declarative data infrastructure:

### Query Engine & Execution
The query engine translates high-level operations into execution plans, while the execution engine orchestrates function calls, manages caching, and ensures data consistency across multimodal transformations.

### Function Ecosystem
Pixeltable provides three types of functions:
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: Custom Python functions you write
- **AI Functions**: Pre-built integrations with models (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- **System Functions**: Built-in operations for media processing and data manipulation

### Data & Schema Layer
The data layer natively supports multimodal data types and treats functions as first-class citizens. Your data transformations aren't separate scriptsâ€”they're computed columns that live inside your tables and automatically update when source data changes.

### Storage & Persistence
Built on PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector operations, providing ACID transactions, version control, and built-in vector search capabilities.

## Key Concepts

### Declarative Workflows
In Pixeltable, you define *what* transformations you want rather than *how* to execute them. The system handles orchestration, error handling, and optimization automatically.

### Incremental Computation
Pixeltable automatically tracks dependencies and only recomputes what's necessary when data or transformations change. This provides significant cost savings and performance improvements.

### Multimodal Type System
Native support for images, videos, audio, documents, and embeddings means you don't need separate storage solutions or complex data pipelines.

### Version Control
Every change is tracked with full lineage. You can revert operations, compare results across versions, and debug issues by examining historical state.

## For AI-first applications

Pixeltable is designed specifically for AI workflows with features that make building with LLMs and multimodal models easier and more reliable:

1. **Function Orchestration**: AI function calls are automatically batched, cached, and retried. Rate limiting and error handling are built-in.

2. **Incremental Computation**: Only recomputes what's necessary when data or code changes, saving time and cost.

3. **Version Control**: Every change is tracked with full lineage for debugging and rollbacks.

4. **Embedding Indexes**: Built-in vector search with automatic index maintenance.

5. **Consistency Guarantees**: Ensures all computed values stay in sync across complex transformation pipelines.

Together, these features mean you can build sophisticated AI applications with simple, maintainable code while Pixeltable handles the complex orchestration, caching, and consistency challenges in the background.

Pixeltable’s Fireworks integration enables you to access LLMs hosted on
the Fireworks platform.

### Prerequisites

-   A Fireworks account with an API key (https://fireworks.ai/api-keys)

### Important Notes

-   Fireworks usage may incur costs based on your Fireworks plan.
-   Be mindful of sensitive data and consider security measures when
    integrating with external services.

First you’ll need to install required libraries and enter a Fireworks
API key.


```python
%pip install -qU pixeltable fireworks-ai
```


```python
import os
import getpass

if 'FIREWORKS_API_KEY' not in os.environ:
    os.environ['FIREWORKS_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('Fireworks API Key:')
```

Now let’s create a Pixeltable directory to hold the tables for our demo.


```python
import pixeltable as pxt

# Remove the 'fireworks_demo' directory and its contents, if it exists
pxt.drop_dir('fireworks_demo', force=True)
pxt.create_dir('fireworks_demo')
```

``` text
Connected to Pixeltable database at: postgresql+psycopg://postgres:@/pixeltable?host=/Users/asiegel/.pixeltable/pgdata
Created directory 'fireworks_demo'.
```

``` text
<pixeltable.catalog.dir.Dir at 0x301799de0>
```

## Completions

Create a Table: In Pixeltable, create a table with columns to represent
your input data and the columns where you want to store the results from
Fireworks.


```python
from pixeltable.functions.fireworks import chat_completions

# Create a table in Pixeltable and pick a model hosted on Fireworks with some parameters

t = pxt.create_table('fireworks_demo.chat', {'input': pxt.String})

messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': t.input}]
t.add_computed_column(output=chat_completions(
    messages=messages,
    model='accounts/fireworks/models/mixtral-8x22b-instruct',
    model_kwargs={
        # Optional dict with parameters for the Fireworks API
        'max_tokens': 300,
        'top_k': 40,
        'top_p': 0.9,
        'temperature': 0.7
    }
))
```

``` text
Created table `chat`.
Added 0 column values with 0 errors.
```

``` text
UpdateStatus(num_rows=0, num_computed_values=0, num_excs=0, updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])
```


```python
# Parse the bot_response into a new column
t.add_computed_column(response=t.output.choices[0].message.content)
```

``` text
Added 0 column values with 0 errors.
```

``` text
UpdateStatus(num_rows=0, num_computed_values=0, num_excs=0, updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])
```


```python
# Start a conversation
t.insert(input="Can you tell me who was President of the US in 1961?")
t.select(t.input, t.response).show()
```

``` text
Inserting rows into `chat`: 1 rows [00:00, 85.10 rows/s]
Inserted 1 row with 0 errors.
```

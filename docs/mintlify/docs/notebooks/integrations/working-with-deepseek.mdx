<td>What was the outcome of the 1904 US Presidential election?</td>
<td>The **1904 U.S. Presidential election** resulted in a decisive
victory for the incumbent **Republican** President **Theodore
Roosevelt**, who had assumed office in 1901 after the assassination of
William McKinley. ### **Key Results:** - **Theodore Roosevelt
(Republican)** won **56.4%** of the popular vote and **336 electoral
votes** (70.6% of the total). - **Alton B. Parker (Democrat)** received
**37.6%** of the popular vote and **140 electoral votes**. - **Eugene V.
Debs (Socialist)** and **Silas C. Swallow (Prohibition)** also ran but
received minimal support. ### **Significance:** - Roosevelt's landslide
victory solidified his leadership and progressive policies, including
trust-busting and conservation efforts. - This was the first election in
which a sitting president who had inherited the office (rather than
being elected to it) won a full term in his own right. Roosevelt carried
**32 of the 45 states**, demonstrating broad national support.</td>

\# Working with Deepseek in Pixeltable

Pixeltable’s Deepseek integration enables you to access Deepseek’s LLM
via the Deepseek API.

### Prerequisites

-   A Deepseek account with an API key (https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)

### Important Notes

-   Deepseek usage may incur costs based on your Deepseek plan.
-   Be mindful of sensitive data and consider security measures when
    integrating with external services.

First you’ll need to install the required libraries and enter a Deepseek
API key. Deepseek uses the OpenAI SDK as its Python API, so we need to
install it in addition to Pixeltable.


```python
%pip install -qU pixeltable openai
```


```python
import os
import getpass

if 'DEEPSEEK_API_KEY' not in os.environ:
    os.environ['DEEPSEEK_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('Deepseek API Key:')
```

Now let’s create a Pixeltable directory to hold the tables for our demo.


```python
import pixeltable as pxt

# Remove the 'deepseek_demo' directory and its contents, if it exists
pxt.drop_dir('deepseek_demo', force=True)
pxt.create_dir('deepseek_demo')
```

``` text
Connected to Pixeltable database at: postgresql+psycopg://postgres:@/pixeltable?host=/Users/asiegel/.pixeltable/pgdata
Created directory 'deepseek_demo'.
```

``` text
<pixeltable.catalog.dir.Dir at 0x16bcf2140>
```

## Messages

Create a Table: In Pixeltable, create a table with columns to represent
your input data and the columns where you want to store the results from
Deepseek.


```python
from pixeltable.functions import deepseek

# Create a table in Pixeltable and add a computed column that calls Deepseek

t = pxt.create_table('deepseek_demo.chat', {'input': pxt.String})

msgs = [{'role': 'user', 'content': t.input}]
t.add_computed_column(output=deepseek.chat_completions(
    messages=msgs,
    model='deepseek-chat',
))
```

``` text
Created table `chat`.
Added 0 column values with 0 errors.
```

``` text
UpdateStatus(num_rows=0, num_computed_values=0, num_excs=0, updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])
```


```python
# Parse the response into a new column
t.add_computed_column(response=t.output.choices[0].message.content)
```

``` text
Added 0 column values with 0 errors.
```

``` text
UpdateStatus(num_rows=0, num_computed_values=0, num_excs=0, updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])
```


```python
# Start a conversation
t.insert(input="What was the outcome of the 1904 US Presidential election?")
t.select(t.input, t.response).show()
```

``` text
Inserting rows into `chat`: 1 rows [00:00, 105.11 rows/s]
Inserted 1 row with 0 errors.
```

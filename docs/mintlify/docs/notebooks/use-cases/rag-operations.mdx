city of churches and synagogues, it was called "Russian Toledo " by
artist Ilya Repin , after the cosmopolitan city of the former Spanish
Empire . [19] Because the city was built mostly of wood, little of it

a variant of the name Segal , which in a Jewish community was usually
borne by a Levitic family. [20] His father, Khatskl (Zachar) Shagal, was
employed by a herring merchant, and his mother, Feige-Ite, sold
groceries from their home. His father worked hard, carrying heavy
barrels, earning 20 roubles each month (the average wages across the
Russian Empire was 13 roubles a month). Chagall wrote of those early
years:</td>

galley-slave. Why try to hide it? How tell about it? No word will ever
ease my father's lot... There was always plenty of butter and cheese on
our table. Buttered bread, like an eternal symbol, was never out of my

[22] From the late 18th century to the First World War, the Imperial
Russian government confined Jews to living within the Pale of Settlement
, which included modern Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia,
almost exactly corresponding to the territory of the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth which was taken over by Imperial Russia in the late 18th
century. That led to the creation of Jewish market-villages ( shtetls )
throughout today's Eastern Europe, with their own markets, schools,
hospitals, and other community institutions. [23] : 14</td>

butchers' windows. There you can see calves that are still alive lying
beside the butchers' hatchets and knives". [25] [26] When asked by some
pogromniks "Jew or not?", Chagall remembered thinking: "My pockets are
empty, my fingers sensitive, my legs weak and they are out for blood. My
death would be futile. I so wanted to live". [25] [26] Chagall denied
being a Jew, leading the pogromniks to shout "All right! Get along!"

<td>Most of what is known about Chagall's early life has come from his
autobiography, My Life . In it, he described the major influence that
the culture of Hasidic Judaism had on his life as an artist. Chagall
related how he realised that the Jewish traditions in which he had grown
up were fast disappearing and that he needed to document them. From the
1730s, Vitebsk itself had been a centre of that culture, with its
teachings derived from the Kabbalah . Chagall scholar, Susan Tumarkin
Goodman, describes the links and sources of his art to his early
home:</td>

<td>Chagall's art can be understood as the response to a situation that
has long marked the history of Russian Jews. Though they were cultural
innovators who made important contributions to the broader society, Jews
were considered outsiders in a frequently hostile society ... Chagall
himself was born of a family steeped in religious life; his parents were
observant Hasidic Jews who found spiritual satisfaction in a life
defined by their faith and organized by prayer. [23] : 14</td>

<td>In the Russian Empire at that time, Jewish children were not allowed
to attend regular schools and universities imposed a quota on Jews .
Their movement within the city was also restricted. Chagall therefore
received his primary education at the local Jewish religious school,
where he studied Hebrew and the Bible. At the age of 13, his mother
tried to enrol him in a regular high school, and he recalled: "But in
that school, they don't take Jews. Without a moment's hesitation, my
courageous mother walks up to a professor." She offered the headmaster
50 roubles to let him attend, which he accepted. [21]</td>

<td>A turning point of his artistic life came when he first noticed a
fellow student drawing. Baal-Teshuva writes that, for the young Chagall,
watching someone draw "was like a vision, a revelation in black and
white". Chagall would later say that there was no art of any kind in his
family's home and the concept was totally alien to him. When Chagall
asked the schoolmate how he learned to draw, his friend replied, "Go and
find a book in the library, idiot, choose any picture you like, and just
copy it". He soon began copying images from books and found the
experience so rewarding he then decided he wanted to become an artist.

# RAG Operations in Pixeltable

In this tutorial, we’ll explore Pixeltable’s flexible handling of RAG
operations on unstructured text. In a traditional AI workflow, such
operations might be implemented as a Python script that runs on a
periodic schedule or in response to certain events. In Pixeltable, as
with everything else, they are implemented as persistent table
operations that update incrementally as new data becomes available. In
our tutorial workflow, we’ll chunk Wikipedia articles in various ways
with a document splitter, then apply several kinds of embeddings to the
chunks.

## Set Up the Table Structure

We start by installing the necessary dependencies, creating a Pixeltable
directory `rag_ops_demo` (if it doesn’t already exist), and setting up
the table structure for our new workflow.


```python
%pip install -qU pixeltable sentence-transformers spacy tiktoken
```


```python
import pixeltable as pxt

# Ensure a clean slate for the demo
pxt.drop_dir('rag_ops_demo', force=True)
# Create the Pixeltable workspace
pxt.create_dir('rag_ops_demo')
```

``` text
Connected to Pixeltable database at: postgresql+psycopg://postgres:@/pixeltable?host=/Users/asiegel/.pixeltable/pgdata
Created directory `rag_ops_demo`.
```

``` text
<pixeltable.catalog.dir.Dir at 0x341466e50>
```

## Creating Tables and Views

Now we’ll create the tables that represent our workflow, starting with a
table to hold references to source documents. The table contains a
single column `source_doc` whose elements have type `pxt.Document`,
representing a general document instance. In this tutorial, we’ll be
working with HTML documents, but Pixeltable supports a range of other
document types, such as Markdown and PDF.


```python
docs = pxt.create_table(
    'rag_ops_demo.docs',
    {'source_doc': pxt.Document}
)
```

``` text
Created table `docs`.
```

If we take a peek at the `docs` table, we see its very simple structure.


```python
docs
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[2] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[3] }} />

Next we create a view to represent chunks of our HTML documents. A
Pixeltable view is a virtual table, which is dynamically derived from a
source table by applying a transformation and/or selecting a subset of
data. In this case, our view represents a one-to-many transformation
from source documents into individual sentences. This is achieved using
Pixeltable’s built-in `DocumentSplitter` class.

Note that the `docs` table is currently empty, so creating this view
doesn’t actually *do* anything yet: it simply defines an operation that
we want Pixeltable to execute when it sees new data.


```python
from pixeltable.iterators.document import DocumentSplitter

sentences = pxt.create_view(
    'rag_ops_demo.sentences',  # Name of the view
    docs,  # Table from which the view is derived
    iterator=DocumentSplitter.create(
        document=docs.source_doc,
        separators='sentence',  # Chunk docs into sentences
        metadata='title,heading,sourceline'
    )
)
```

``` text
Created view `sentences` with 0 rows, 0 exceptions.
```

Let’s take a peek at the new `sentences` view.


```python
sentences
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[4] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[5] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[6] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[7] }} />

We see that `sentences` inherits the `source_doc` column from `docs`,
together with some new fields: - `pos`: The position in the source
document where the sentence appears. - `text`: The text of the
sentence. - `title`, `heading`, and `sourceline`: The metadata we
requested when we set up the view.

## Data Ingestion

Ok, now it’s time to insert some data into our workflow. A document in
Pixeltable is just a URL; the following command inserts a single row
into the `docs` table with the `source_doc` field set to the specified
URL:


```python
docs.insert([{'source_doc': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Chagall'}])
```

``` text
Computing cells: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████████| 2/2 [00:00<00:00, 14.50 cells/s]
Inserting rows into `docs`: 1 rows [00:00, 739.08 rows/s]
Computing cells: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████████| 2/2 [00:00<00:00, 14.20 cells/s]
Inserting rows into `sentences`: 1460 rows [00:00, 3529.45 rows/s]
Inserted 1461 rows with 0 errors.
```

``` text
UpdateStatus(num_rows=1461, num_computed_values=2, num_excs=0, updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])
```

We can see that two things happened. First, a single row was inserted
into `docs`, containing the URL representing our source document. Then,
the view `sentences` was incrementally updated by applying the
`DocumentSplitter` according to the definition of the view. This
illustrates an important principle in Pixeltable: by default, anytime
Pixeltable sees new data, the update is incrementally propagated to any
downstream views or computed columns.

We can see the effect of the insertion with the `select` command.
There’s a single row in `docs`:


```python
docs.select(docs.source_doc.fileurl).show()
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[8] }} />

And here are the first 20 rows in `sentences`. The content of the
article is broken into individual sentences, as expected.


```python
sentences.select(sentences.text, sentences.heading).show(20)
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[9] }} />

## Experimenting with Chunking

Of course, chunking into sentences isn’t the only way to split a
document. Perhaps we want to experiment with different chunking
methodologies, in order to see which one performs best in a particular
application. Pixeltable makes it easy to do this, by creating several
views of the same source table. Here are a few examples. Notice that as
each new view is created, it is initially populated from the data
already in `docs`.


```python
chunks = pxt.create_view(
    'rag_ops_demo.chunks', docs,
    iterator=DocumentSplitter.create(
        document=docs.source_doc,
        separators='paragraph,token_limit',
        limit=2048,
        overlap=0,
        metadata='title,heading,sourceline'
    )
)
```

``` text
Inserting rows into `chunks`: 205 rows [00:00, 16715.90 rows/s]
Created view `chunks` with 205 rows, 0 exceptions.
```


```python
short_chunks = pxt.create_view(
    'rag_ops_demo.short_chunks', docs,
    iterator=DocumentSplitter.create(
        document=docs.source_doc,
        separators='paragraph,token_limit',
        limit=72,
        overlap=0,
        metadata='title,heading,sourceline'
    )
)
```

``` text
Inserting rows into `short_chunks`: 531 rows [00:00, 23858.59 rows/s]
Created view `short_chunks` with 531 rows, 0 exceptions.
```


```python
short_char_chunks = pxt.create_view(
    'rag_ops_demo.short_char_chunks', docs,
    iterator=DocumentSplitter.create(
        document=docs.source_doc,
        separators='paragraph,char_limit',
        limit=72,
        overlap=0,
        metadata='title,heading,sourceline'
    )
)
```

``` text
Inserting rows into `short_char_chunks`: 1764 rows [00:00, 17427.53 rows/s]
Created view `short_char_chunks` with 1764 rows, 0 exceptions.
```


```python
chunks.select(chunks.text, chunks.heading).show(20)
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[10] }} />


```python
short_chunks.select(short_chunks.text, short_chunks.heading).show(20)
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[11] }} />


```python
short_char_chunks.select(short_char_chunks.text, short_char_chunks.heading).show(20)
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[12] }} />

Now let’s add a few more documents to our workflow. Notice how all of
the downstream views are updated incrementally, processing just the new
documents as they are inserted.


```python
urls = [
    'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir',
    'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Matisse',
    'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp'
]
docs.insert({'source_doc': url} for url in urls)
```

``` text

Inserted 5835 rows with 0 errors.
```

``` text
UpdateStatus(num_rows=5835, num_computed_values=6, num_excs=0, updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])
```

``` text

Inserted 5831 rows with 0 errors.
```

``` text
UpdateStatus(num_rows=5831, num_computed_values=0, num_excs=0, updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])
```

## Further Experiments

This is a good time to mention another important guiding principle of
Pixeltable. The preceding examples all used the built-in
`DocumentSplitter` class with various configurations. That’s probably
fine as a first cut or to prototype an application quickly, and it might
be sufficient for some applications. But other applications might want
to do more sophisticated kinds of chunking, implementing their own
specialized logic or leveraging third-party tools. Pixeltable imposes no
constraints on the AI or RAG operations a workflow uses: the iterator
interface is highly general, and it’s easy to implement new operations
or adapt existing code or third-party tools into the Pixeltable
workflow.

## Computing Embeddings

Next, let’s look at how embedding indices can be added seamlessly to
existing Pixeltable workflows. To compute our embeddings, we’ll use the
Huggingface `sentence_transformer` package, running it over the `chunks`
view that broke our documents up into larger paragraphs. Pixeltable has
a built-in `sentence_transformer` adapter, and all we have to do is add
a new column that leverages it. Pixeltable takes care of the rest,
applying the new column to all existing data in the view.


```python
from pixeltable.functions.huggingface import sentence_transformer

chunks.add_computed_column(minilm_embed=sentence_transformer(
    chunks.text,
    model_id='paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2'
))
```

``` text
Computing cells: 100%|███████████████████████████████████████| 481/481 [00:02<00:00, 222.59 cells/s]
Added 481 column values with 0 errors.
```

``` text
UpdateStatus(num_rows=481, num_computed_values=481, num_excs=0, updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])
```

The new column is a *computed column*: it is defined as a function on
top of existing data and updated incrementally as new data are added to
the workflow. Let’s have a look at how the new column affected the
`chunks` view.


```python
chunks
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[13] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[14] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[15] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[16] }} />


```python
chunks.select(chunks.text, chunks.heading, chunks.minilm_embed).head()
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[17] }} />

Similarly, we might want to add a CLIP embedding to our workflow; once
again, it’s just another computed column:


```python
from pixeltable.functions.huggingface import clip

chunks.add_computed_column(clip_embed=clip(
    chunks.text, model_id='openai/clip-vit-base-patch32'
))
```

``` text
Computing cells: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████| 481/481 [00:05<00:00, 93.49 cells/s]
Added 481 column values with 0 errors.
```

``` text
UpdateStatus(num_rows=481, num_computed_values=481, num_excs=0, updated_cols=[], cols_with_excs=[])
```


```python
chunks
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[18] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[19] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[20] }} />

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[21] }} />


```python
chunks.select(chunks.text, chunks.heading, chunks.clip_embed).head()
```

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[22] }} />

list of pixel counts, one for each pixel value in the source image. Counts are grouped into 256 bins for each band, even if the image has more than 8 bits per band. If the image has more than one band, the histograms for all bands are concatenated (for example, the histogram for an "RGB" image contains 768 values).

A bilevel image (mode "1") is treated as a grayscale ("L") image by this method.

If a mask is provided, the method returns a histogram for those parts of the image where the mask image is non-zero. The mask image must have the same size as the image, and be either a bi-level image (mode "1") or a grayscale image ("L").

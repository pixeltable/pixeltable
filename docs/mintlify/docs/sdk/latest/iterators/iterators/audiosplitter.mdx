description: "Iterator over chunks of an audio file. The audio file is split into smaller chunks,"
icon: "square-c"
---

where the duration of each chunk is determined by chunk_duration_sec. The iterator yields audio chunks as pxt.Audio, along with the start and end time of each chunk. If the input contains no audio, no chunks are yielded.


## Constructor

```python
AudioSplitter(
    self,
    audio: str,
    chunk_duration_sec: float,
    *,
    overlap_sec: float = 0.0,
    min_chunk_duration_sec: float = 0.0
)
```

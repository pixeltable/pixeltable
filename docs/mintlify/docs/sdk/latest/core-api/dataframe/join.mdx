## Signature

```python
join(other: 'catalog.Table', on: 'exprs.Expr | Sequence[exprs.ColumnRef] | None' = None, how: 'plan.JoinType.LiteralType' = 'inner') -> 'DataFrame'
```

## Parameters

<ParamField path="other" type="any" required>
  the table to join with

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="on" type="any" >
  the join condition, which can be either a) references to one or more columns or b) a boolean expression.

- column references: implies an equality predicate that matches columns in both this DataFrame and `other` by name.

  - column in `other`: A column with that same name must be present in this DataFrame, and **it must be unique** (otherwise the join is ambiguous).
  - column in this DataFrame: A column with that same name must be present in `other`.

- boolean expression: The expressions must be valid in the context of the joined tables.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="how" type="any" >
  the type of join to perform.

- `'inner'`: only keep rows that have a match in both
- `'left'`: keep all rows from this DataFrame and only matching rows from the other table
- `'right'`: keep all rows from the other table and only matching rows from this DataFrame
- `'full_outer'`: keep all rows from both this DataFrame and the other table
- `'cross'`: Cartesian product; no `on` condition allowed

</ParamField>

## Returns

A new DataFrame.


## Examples

```python
Perform an inner join between t1 and t2 on the column id:

>>> join1 = t1.join(t2, on=t2.id)

Perform a left outer join of join1 with t3, also on id (note that we can't specify `on=t3.id` here,
because that would be ambiguous, since both t1 and t2 have a column named id):

>>> join2 = join1.join(t3, on=t2.id, how='left')

Do the same, but now with an explicit join predicate:

>>> join2 = join1.join(t3, on=t2.id == t3.id, how='left')

Join t with d, which has a composite primary key (columns pk1 and pk2, with corresponding foreign
key columns d1 and d2 in t):

>>> df = t.join(d, on=(t.d1 == d.pk1) & (t.d2 == d.pk2), how='left')
```

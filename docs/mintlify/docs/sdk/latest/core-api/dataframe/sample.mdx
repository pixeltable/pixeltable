## ⚠️ Documentation Issues

<Warning>
- Examples section exists in docstring but was not parsed by docstring_parser
</Warning>

The size of the sample can be specified in three ways:

- `n`: the total number of rows to produce as a sample
- `n_per_stratum`: the number of rows to produce per stratum as a sample
- `fraction`: the fraction of available rows to produce as a sample

The sample can be stratified by one or more columns, which means that the sample will be selected from each stratum separately.

The data is shuffled before creating the sample.


## Signature

```python
sample(n: 'Optional[int]' = None, n_per_stratum: 'Optional[int]' = None, fraction: 'Optional[float]' = None, seed: 'Optional[int]' = None, stratify_by: 'Any' = None) -> 'DataFrame'
```

## Parameters

<ParamField path="n" type="any" >
  Total number of rows to produce as a sample.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="n_per_stratum" type="any" >
  Number of rows to produce per stratum as a sample. This parameter is only valid if `stratify_by` is specified. Only one of `n` or `n_per_stratum` can be specified.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fraction" type="any" >
  Fraction of available rows to produce as a sample. This parameter is not usable with `n` or `n_per_stratum`. The fraction must be between 0.0 and 1.0.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="seed" type="any" >
  Random seed for reproducible shuffling

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="stratify_by" type="any" >
  If specified, the sample will be stratified by these values.

</ParamField>

## Returns

A new DataFrame which specifies the sampled rows


## Examples

```python
Given the Table `person` containing the field 'age', we can create samples of the table in various ways:

Sample 100 rows from the above Table:

>>> df = person.sample(n=100)

Sample 10% of the rows from the above Table:

>>> df = person.sample(fraction=0.1)

Sample 10% of the rows from the above Table, stratified by the column 'age':

>>> df = person.sample(fraction=0.1, stratify_by=t.age)

Equal allocation sampling: Sample 2 rows from each age present in the above Table:

>>> df = person.sample(n_per_stratum=2, stratify_by=t.age)

Sampling is compatible with the where clause, so we can also sample from a filtered DataFrame:

>>> df = person.where(t.age > 30).sample(n=100)
```

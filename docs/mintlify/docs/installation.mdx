# Getting Started with Pixeltable

This is a step-by-step guide to setting up a local installation of Pixeltable. If you'd prefer to use a cloud notebook platform such as Kaggle or Colab, see the "Quick Start" section of the [Overview](https://pixeltable.readme.io/docs/get-started/) instead.

You'll want to install Pixeltable in a Python virtual environment; we'll use Apache Miniconda in this guide, but any environment manager should work.

**Pixeltable works with Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 running on Linux, MacOS, or Windows.**

## Install Pixeltable

1. Install Miniconda here: [Installing Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/)

2. Create your environment:

   * `conda create --name pxt python=3.11` (You can choose to use any Python version between 3.9 and 3.12.)
   * `conda activate pxt`

3. Install Pixeltable and Jupyter inside the new environment:

   * `pip install pixeltable jupyter`

## Create a Notebook

4. Start your Jupyter notebook server:

   * `jupyter notebook`

5. Create a new notebook:

   * Select "Python 3 (ipykernel)" as the kernel
   * File / New / Notebook

6. Test that everything is working by entering these commands into the notebook:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  import pixeltable as pxt
  pxt.init()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

7. Wait a minute for Pixeltable to load; then you should see a message indicating that Pixeltable has successfully connected to the database.

You can also get started by running through the [https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/pixeltable-basics](/docs/pixeltable-basics) in Google Colab.

# Advanced Configuration (Optional)

Pixeltable configuration options can be specified in one of two ways:

* Using environment variables, such as `PIXELTABLE_HOME` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`; and/or
* In the system configuration file `$PIXELTABLE_HOME/config.toml` (usually `~/.pixeltable/config.toml`).

The system configuration file follows the usual TOML format with headings and values:

<CodeGroup>
  ```toml toml
  [pixeltable]
  file_cache_size_g = 250

  [openai]
  api_key = 'my-openai-api-key'

  [label_studio]
  url = 'http://localhost:8080/'
  api_key = 'my-label-studio-api-key'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Most options can be specified either as an environment variable or in `config.toml`, although a few can only be specified as an environment variable. It is fine for some options to be given as environment variables and others in `config.toml`. If a configuration parameter is specified both ways, the environment variable will be used preferentially.

| PIXELTABLE\_DB                   |                                   | (string) Pixeltable database name; default is `pixeltable`                             |
| PIXELTABLE\_FILE\_CACHE\_SIZE\_G | \[pixeltable]file\_cache\_size\_g | (float) Maximum size of the Pixeltable file cache, in GiB                              |

## Why use computed columns?

Computed columns are permanent columns added to a table, computed based on expressions involving other columns, and automatically updated when the source data changes. 

You would use computed columns when you want to:

- Compute a value based on the contents of other columns
- Automatically update the computed value when the source data changes
- Simplify queries by avoiding the need to write complex expressions

## How to create a computed column

```python
import pixeltable as pxt

pxt.drop_dir('fundamentals', force=True)
pxt.create_dir('fundamentals')
pop_t = pxt.io.import_csv(
    'fundamentals.population',
    'https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/raw/main/docs/source/data/world-population-data.csv'
)

# yoy_change is the column name and the expression is the formula
pop_t.add_computed_column(yoy_change=(pop_t.pop_2023 - pop_t.pop_2022))
```
As soon as the column is added, Pixeltable will (by default) automatically compute its value for all rows in the table, storing the results in the new column.

<Note>
In traditional data workflows, it is commonplace to recompute entire pipelines when the input dataset is changed or enlarged. In Pixeltable, by contrast, all updates are applied incrementally. When new data appear in a table or existing data are altered, Pixeltable will recompute only those rows that are dependent on the changed data.
</Note>

## Building workflows

Let's explore another example that uses computed columns for image processing operations.

```python
t = pxt.create_table('fundamentals.image_ops', {'source': pxt.Image})

t.add_computed_column(metadata=t.source.get_metadata())

t.add_computed_column(rotated=t.source.rotate(10))

t.add_computed_column(rotated_transparent=t.source.convert('RGBA').rotate(10))
```

Once we insert data, it will automatically compute the values for the new columns.

```python
url_prefix = 'https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/raw/main/docs/source/data/images'
images = ['000000000139.jpg', '000000000632.jpg', '000000000872.jpg']
t.insert({'source': f'{url_prefix}/{image}'} for image in images)
```

Pixeltable will automatically manage the dependencies between the columns, so that when the source image is updated, the rotated and rotated_transparent columns are automatically recomputed.

You don't need to think about orchestration. Our DAG engine will take care of the dependencies for you.

## Advanced Usage

### Using Python Functions

You can use Python functions in computed columns using the `@pxt.udf` decorator:

```python
@pxt.udf
def calculate_growth_rate(current: float, previous: float) -> float:
    return ((current - previous) / previous) * 100

pop_t.add_computed_column(
    growth_rate=calculate_growth_rate(pop_t.pop_2023, pop_t.pop_2022)
)
```

### Chaining Computations

Computed columns can depend on other computed columns:

```python
# First computed column
pop_t.add_computed_column(total_change=pop_t.pop_2023 - pop_t.pop_2020)

# Second computed column using the first
pop_t.add_computed_column(
    avg_yearly_change=pop_t.total_change / 3
)
```

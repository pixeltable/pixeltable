## What is Sampling?

Sampling in Pixeltable allows you to select a subset of rows from a table or view. This is a crucial technique in data analysis and machine learning for creating smaller, manageable datasets that are representative of the whole.

You would use sampling to:
-   **Explore Data**: Quickly get a feel for a large dataset without processing all of it.
-   **Develop and Test**: Create smaller datasets for faster development cycles and testing of data pipelines.
-   **Train ML Models**: Generate balanced or representative training sets, especially with large and imbalanced data.
-   **Reduce Computational Cost**: Perform expensive computations on a smaller subset of data.

Pixeltable provides several methods for sampling, including random sampling of a fixed number of rows, sampling a fraction of the data, and stratified sampling to ensure representation across different subgroups.

```python
import pixeltable as pxt

# Import the population dataset
pop_t = pxt.create_table(
    'population',
    source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/release/docs/resources/world-population-data.csv',
    if_exists='ignore'
)

# Get a random sample of 20 countries
sample_df = pop_t.sample(n=20, seed=42)
print(sample_df.collect())
```

## Basic Sampling Methods

Pixeltable offers simple ways to draw random samples from your data.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sample by Number (n)">
    Use `n` to get a fixed number of randomly selected rows. This is useful when you need a dataset of a specific size.

    ```python
    # Get a random sample of 5 rows
    random_sample = pop_t.sample(n=5, seed=123)
    print(random_sample.collect())
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sample by Fraction">
    Use `fraction` to get a percentage of the total rows. This is useful for scaling down a dataset proportionally. The value should be between 0.0 and 1.0. For sampling with `fraction`, each row is selected independently with probability p.

    ```python
    # Get a 1% random sample of the data
    fractional_sample = pop_t.sample(fraction=0.01, seed=123)
    print(fractional_sample.collect())
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reproducibility with `seed`">
    The `seed` parameter ensures that your sampling is deterministic. Using the same seed will always produce the same sample, which is critical for reproducible experiments and tests.

    ```python
    # This will always return the same 3 rows
    reproducible_sample = pop_t.sample(n=3, seed=42)
    print(reproducible_sample.collect())
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Stratified Sampling

Stratified sampling is a technique that ensures subgroups within your data are represented proportionally in the sample. This is useful when you want to ensure that your sample accurately reflects the diversity of the original dataset.

For example, using our `population` table, we can perform stratified sampling to get a sample of countries that is representative of the different continents.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sample `n_per_stratum`" icon="layer-group">
    This method samples a fixed number of rows from each subgroup (stratum). This is useful for ensuring that even small subgroups are represented in your sample.

    ```python
    # Sample 2 countries from each continent
    stratified_sample = pop_t.sample(
        n_per_stratum=2, 
        stratify_by=[pop_t.continent], 
        seed=42
    )
    print(stratified_sample.collect())
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sample `n` with stratification" icon="list-ol">
    This method samples a total of `n` rows, with the number of rows from each stratum proportional to its size in the original dataset.

    ```python
    # Sample a total of 20 countries, stratified by continent
    proportional_sample = pop_t.sample(
        n=20, 
        stratify_by=[pop_t.continent], 
        seed=42
    )
    print(proportional_sample.collect())
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sample `fraction` with stratification" icon="percent">
    This method samples a fraction of rows from each stratum.

    ```python
    # Sample 10% of countries from each continent
    fractional_stratified = pop_t.sample(
        fraction=0.1, 
        stratify_by=[pop_t.continent], 
        seed=42
    )
    print(fractional_stratified.collect())
    ```
  </Accordion>

## Usage and Limitations

The `sample()` operation has specific rules about how it can be used in a query chain.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Chaining with `where()`" icon="filter">
    You can apply a `where()` clause before `sample()` to filter the data before sampling. This is the most common way to chain operations with `sample()`.

    ```python
    # Sample 5 countries with a population greater than 100 million
    large_countries_sample = pop_t.where(
        pop_t.pop_2023 > 100000000
    ).sample(n=5, seed=42)
    print(large_countries_sample.collect())
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Creating Snapshots and Tables" icon="camera">
    A common use case for `sample()` is to create a smaller, persistent snapshot or a new table for development, testing, or analysis.

    ```python
    # Create a sample DataFrame
    sample_df = pop_t.sample(fraction=0.1, seed=42)

    # Create a persistent snapshot from the sample
    pxt.create_snapshot('population_sample_snapshot', sample_df, if_exists='replace')

    # Create a new table from the sample
    pxt.create_table('population_sample_table', source=sample_df, if_exists='replace')
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limitations" icon="ban">
    The `sample()` operation cannot be chained with most other DataFrame operations like `join()`, `group_by()`, `order_by()`, or `limit()`. It also cannot be used to create a `view`. These limitations exist to ensure the statistical properties of the sample are well-defined.

    ```python
    # This will raise an error
    try:
        pop_t.order_by(pop_t.pop_2023).sample(n=10)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    ```

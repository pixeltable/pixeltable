## What is Sampling?

Sampling in Pixeltable allows you to select a subset of rows from a table or view. This is a crucial technique in data analysis and machine learning for creating smaller, manageable datasets that are representative of the whole.

You would use sampling to:
-   **Explore Data**: Quickly get a feel for a large dataset without processing all of it.
-   **Develop and Test**: Create smaller datasets for faster development cycles and testing of data pipelines.
-   **Train ML Models**: Generate balanced or representative training sets, especially with large and imbalanced data.
-   **Reduce Computational Cost**: Perform expensive computations on a smaller subset of data.

Pixeltable provides several methods for sampling, including random sampling of a fixed number of rows, sampling a fraction of the data, and stratified sampling to ensure representation across different subgroups.

```python
import pixeltable as pxt

# Import the earthquake dataset
eq_t = pxt.create_table(
    'earthquakes',
    source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/release/docs/resources/earthquakes.csv',
    if_exists='ignore'
)

# Get a random sample of 20 earthquakes
sample_df = eq_t.sample(n=20, seed=42)
sample_df.collect()
```

## Basic Sampling Methods

Pixeltable offers simple ways to draw random samples from your data.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sample by Number (n)">
    Use `n` to get a fixed number of randomly selected rows. This is useful when you need a dataset of a specific size.

    ```python
    # Get a random sample of 5 rows
    random_sample = eq_t.sample(n=5, seed=123)
    random_sample.collect()
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sample by Fraction">
    Use `fraction` to get a percentage of the total rows. This is useful for scaling down a dataset proportionally. The value should be between 0.0 and 1.0. For sampling with `fraction`, each row is selected independently with probability p.

    ```python
    # Get a 1% random sample of the data
    fractional_sample = eq_t.sample(fraction=0.01, seed=123)
    fractional_sample.collect()
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reproducibility with `seed`">
    The `seed` parameter ensures that your sampling is deterministic. Using the same seed will always produce the same sample, which is critical for reproducible experiments and tests.

    ```python
    # This will always return the same 3 rows
    reproducible_sample = eq_t.sample(n=3, seed=42)
    reproducible_sample.collect()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Stratified Sampling

Stratified sampling is an advanced technique that ensures subgroups within your data are represented proportionally in the sample. To illustrate this, let's first add a `state` column to our earthquake data by extracting it from the `location` string.

```python
# Define a UDF to extract the state
@pxt.udf
def get_state(location: str) -> str:
    return location.split(',')[-1].strip()

# Add a 'state' column to the table
eq_t.add_computed_column(state=get_state(eq_t.location))
eq_t.head()
```

Now we can use the `state` column for stratified sampling.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sample `n_per_stratum`" icon="layer-group">
    This method samples a fixed number of rows from each subgroup (stratum). This is useful for ensuring that even small subgroups are represented in your sample.

    ```python
    # Sample 2 earthquakes from each state
    stratified_sample = eq_t.sample(
        n_per_stratum=2, 
        stratify_by=[eq_t.state], 
        seed=42
    )
    stratified_sample.collect()
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sample `n` with stratification" icon="list-ol">
    This method samples a total of `n` rows, with the number of rows from each stratum proportional to its size in the original dataset.

    ```python
    # Sample a total of 20 earthquakes, stratified by state
    proportional_sample = eq_t.sample(
        n=20, 
        stratify_by=[eq_t.state], 
        seed=42
    )
    proportional_sample.collect()
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sample `fraction` with stratification" icon="percent">
    This method samples a fraction of rows from each stratum.

    ```python
    # Sample 10% of earthquakes from each state
    fractional_stratified = eq_t.sample(
        fraction=0.1, 
        stratify_by=[eq_t.state], 
        seed=42
    )
    fractional_stratified.collect()
    ```

## Usage and Limitations

The `sample()` operation has specific rules about how it can be used in a query chain.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Chaining with `where()`" icon="filter">
    You can apply a `where()` clause before `sample()` to filter the data before sampling. This is the most common way to chain operations with `sample()`.

    ```python
    # Sample 5 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 2.0
    strong_earthquakes_sample = eq_t.where(
        eq_t.magnitude > 2.0
    ).sample(n=5, seed=42)
    
    strong_earthquakes_sample.collect()
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Creating Snapshots and Tables" icon="camera">
    A common use case for `sample()` is to create a smaller, persistent snapshot or a new table for development, testing, or analysis.

    ```python
    # Create a sample DataFrame
    sample_df = eq_t.sample(fraction=0.1, seed=42)

    # Create a persistent snapshot from the sample
    pxt.create_snapshot('earthquake_sample_snapshot', sample_df, if_exists='replace')

    # Create a new table from the sample
    pxt.create_table('earthquake_sample_table', source=sample_df, if_exists='replace')
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limitations" icon="ban">
    The `sample()` operation cannot be chained with most other DataFrame operations like `join()`, `group_by()`, `order_by()`, or `limit()`. It also cannot be used to create a `view`. These limitations exist to ensure the statistical properties of the sample are well-defined.

    ```python
    # This will raise an error
    try:
        eq_t.order_by(eq_t.magnitude).sample(n=10)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    ```

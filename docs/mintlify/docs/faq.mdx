## Core Concepts

### What is Pixeltable?

Pixeltable is a Python library designed for working with multimodal data, including text, images, audio, and video. It offers a declarative interface that simplifies data storage, transformation, indexing, and iteration. Unlike in-memory libraries like Pandas, Pixeltable is a database with persistent storage, enabling you to manage large datasets and track changes effectively.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  import pixeltable as pxt

  # Create a table with multiple data types
  table = pxt.create_table('multimodal', {
     'text': pxt.StringType(),
     'image': pxt.ImageType(),
     'video': pxt.VideoType(), 
     'embedding': pxt.ArrayType()
  })

  # Add computed columns for transformations
  table['object_detections'] = yolox(table.image)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### How does Pixeltable handle data storage?

Pixeltable stores references to media data (images, videos) in their original location while managing derived data products.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Videos stay in original location (S3, local filesystem)
  videos = pxt.create_table('videos', {'video': pxt.VideoType()})
  videos.insert({'video': 's3://bucket/video.mp4'})

  # Computed data (frames, detections) managed by Pixeltable 
  frames = pxt.create_view(
      'frames',
      videos,
      iterator=FrameIterator.create(video=videos.video)
  )
  frames['detections'] = object_detection(frames.frame)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### What are Pixeltable views?

Views are virtual tables based on a query or transformation applied to a base table. They provide a flexible way to interact with data without modifying the original table. Views can be created with filters, aggregations, joins, and other operations.

## Features & Capabilities

### What are the key features of Pixeltable?

* **Multimodal data handling**: Pixeltable handles various data types like text, images, audio, video, and documents.
* **Declarative interface:** simplifies complex data operations.
* **Computed columns**: allow defining data transformations and calculations as part of the table schema.
* **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: extend functionality by writing custom Python code.
* **Incremental updates:** Pixeltable intelligently updates computed columns and data pipelines, processing only new or changed data.
* **Versioning and lineage tracking:** automatically tracks data modifications and dependencies for reproducibility and debugging.
* **Integration with ML/AI tools**: offers pre-built functions for object detection, embedding generation, and interaction with large language models.

### How does incremental processing work?

Pixeltable automatically processes only new or changed data:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python pyt
  # Add new video - only processes the new video
  videos.insert({'video': 'video2.mp4'})  # Incremental processing

  # All computed columns update automatically
  frames.select(frames.detections).where(frames.video == 'video2.mp4').show()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### How do I implement vector search?

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Add embedding index for similarity search
  videos.add_embedding_index('frames', image_embed=embedding_function)

  # Perform similarity search
  results = videos.order_by(
      videos.frames.similarity(query_image),
      asc=False
  ).limit(5).collect()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### How does Pixeltable handle versioning and lineage tracking?

Pixeltable automatically versions tables whenever they are modified. You can revert changes using t.revert(). Lineage tracking records the dependencies between data and computed columns, enabling you to trace back data origins and ensure reproducibility.

## Integration & Deployment

### What external services can I integrate?

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Label Service Integration
  from pixeltable.functions import labelstudio
  table['annotations'] = labelstudio.get_annotations(table.image)

  # Inference Provider Integration
  from pixeltable.functions import openai
  table['embeddings'] = openai.get_embedding(table.text)

  # Cloud Storage Integration
  videos.insert({'video': 's3://bucket/videos/*.mp4'})  # Bulk import
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### How do I deploy to production?

Pixeltable's development environment mirrors production. Your table structure and computed columns work identically in both environments:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Development
  dev_table = pxt.create_table('dev.detection', {
      'video': pxt.VideoType(),
      'detections': object_detection(video.frame)
  })

  # Production - same structure
  prod_table = pxt.create_table('prod.detection', {
      'video': pxt.VideoType(),
      'detections': object_detection(video.frame)
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### How does Pixeltable fit into existing stacks?

Pixeltable integrates with your existing AI workflow:

* **Data Sources & Sinks:** Interfaces with object stores (S3), labeling services (Voxel51, LabelStudio), inference providers (OpenAI, Together, Replicate) and more. Pixeltable makes using these services even easier.
* **Compute & Runtimes:** Works with cloud providers (e.g. AWS), and optimized environments (e.g. Modal).
* **Tools & Libraries:** Integrates with your favorite Python libraries and MLOps tools.

## Common Use Cases

### Can I define custom functions to process data in Pixeltable?

Yes, Pixeltable allows defining User-Defined Functions (UDFs) using the @pxt.udf decorator. These UDFs are regular Python functions that can operate on columns and be used within computed columns or queries. For example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  @pxt.udf
  def longest_word(sentence: str) -> str:
  	words = sentence.split()
  	return max(words, key=len)

  t['longest_word'] = longest_word(t.input)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### How do I implement object detection?

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Create video table
  videos = pxt.create_table('traffic', {'video': pxt.VideoType()})

  # Extract frames
  frames = pxt.create_view(
      'frames',
      videos,
      iterator=FrameIterator.create(video=videos.video)
  )

  # Add detection
  frames['detections'] = yolox(
      frames.frame,
      model_id='yolox_s',
      threshold=0.5
  )

  # Filter relevant frames
  stop_signs = frames.where(frames.detections...))
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### How do I implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)?

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Create document table
  docs = pxt.create_table('documents', {'document': pxt.DocumentType()})

  # Create chunks view
  chunks = pxt.create_view(
      'chunks',
      docs,
      iterator=DocumentSplitter.create(
          document=docs.document,
          separators='token_limit',
          limit=300
      )
  )

  # Add embeddings and index
  chunks['embedding'] = sentence_transformer(chunks.text)
  chunks.add_embedding_index('embedding')

  # Query similar chunks
  results = chunks.order_by(
      chunks.embedding.similarity(query_embedding),
      asc=False
  ).limit(5).collect()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### How should I structure my tables?

* Use computed columns for transformations
* Leverage views for efficient processing
* Take advantage of incremental updates
* Document transformations

### How do I optimize performance?

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Use batch processing where possible
  @pxt.udf(batch_size=32)
  def process_batch(images: list[PIL.Image]) -> list[dict]:
      return model.predict(images)

  # Leverage indexing for faster queries
  table.add_embedding_index('embeddings')

  # Monitor resource usage
  usage = table.select(
      table.column_name,
      table.compute_time,
      table.memory_usage
  ).collect()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

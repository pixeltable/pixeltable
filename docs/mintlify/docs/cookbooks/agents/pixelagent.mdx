# Agent Engineering

We see agents as the intersection of an LLM, storage, and orchestration. Pixelagent unifies this interface into a single declarative framework, making it the de-facto choice for engineers to build custom agentic applications with build-your-own functionality for memory, tool-calling, and advanced patterns.

<Note>
Choose Pixelagent when you need robust data management and persistence in your agent systems. The framework is particularly powerful when building agents that need to maintain context, use tools, or handle multiple types of data.

## Installation and Setup

```bash
pip install pixelagent anthropic
```

```python
from pixelagent.anthropic import Agent

agent = Agent(
    agent_name="financial_analyst",
    system_prompt="You are a CFA working at a top-tier investment bank.",
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"
)

agent.chat("Explain EPS and how it is calculated.")

agent.chat("What was my first question?")
```

## Building Your Agent

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Define Tools" icon="wrench">
    First, create and register your tools with Pixeltable:
    ```python
    import pixeltable as pxt
    from pixelagent.anthropic import Agent
    import yfinance as yf

    @pxt.udf
    def stock_price(ticker: str) -> dict:
        """
        Retrieve the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.
        
        Args:
            ticker (str): Stock ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL' for Apple)
            
        Returns:
            dict: Dictionary containing stock information and metrics
        """
        stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        return stock.info

    # Register the tool with Pixeltable
    tools = pxt.tools(stock_price)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create Agent" icon="robot">
    Initialize your agent with the desired configuration:
    ```python
    agent = Agent(
        agent_name="financial_analyst",  # Unique identifier for this agent
        system_prompt="You are a CFA working at a top-tier investment bank.",  # Agent personality
        tools=tools,  # Register tools with the agent
        reset=True,  # Start with a fresh conversation history,
        n_latest_messages=10,  # Set the last N messages otherwise defaults to infinite memory
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Interact with Agent" icon="comments">
    Start interacting with your agent:
    ```python
    # Basic conversation
    res = agent.chat("Hi, how are you?")
    print(res)

    # Tool calling
    tool_result = agent.tool_call("Get NVIDIA and Apple stock price")
    print(tool_result)

    # Persistant memory
    print(agent.chat("What was my last question?"))
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Declarative Agent Observability" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Query the agent's conversation and tool history:
    ```python
    # Access the agent's conversation history
    memory = pxt.get_table("financial_analyst.memory")
    print("Conversation Memory:")
    print(memory.collect())

    # Access the agent's tool call history
    tools_log = pxt.get_table("financial_analyst.tools")
    print("Tool Call History:")
    print(tools_log.collect())
    ```
  </Accordion>

# Building Pixeltable with LLMs

You can use large language models (LLMs) to assist in building Pixeltable integrations. We provide a set of tools and best practices if you use LLMs during development.

## Plain text docs

You can access all of our documentation as plain text markdown files by adding `.md` to the end of any url. For example, you can find the plain text version of this page itself at [https://docs.pixeltable.com/overview/building-pixeltable-with-llms.md](https://docs.pixeltable.com/overview/building-pixeltable-with-llms.md).

This helps AI tools and agents consume our content and allows you to copy and paste the entire contents of a doc into an LLM. This format is preferable to scraping or copying from our HTML and JavaScript-rendered pages because:

* Plain text contains fewer formatting tokens.
* Content that isn't rendered in the default view (for example, it's hidden in a tab) of a given page is rendered in the plain text version.
* LLMs can parse and understand markdown hierarchy.

We host two files to assist AI tools and agents:

1. [/llms.txt](https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms.txt): This file instructs how to retrieve plain text versions of our pages. It follows the [emerging standard](https://llmstxt.org/) for making websites and content more accessible to LLMs.

2. [/llms-full.txt](https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms-full.txt): This file contains more comprehensive instructions and metadata about our documentation structure.

These files help AI tools navigate and understand our documentation more effectively.

## Pixeltable Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

For developers using code editors that use AI, such as Cursor or Windsurf, or general purpose tools such as Claude Desktop, we provide the [Pixeltable Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/libraries/mcp) server. The MCP server provides AI agents a set of tools for calling the Pixeltable API and searching our knowledge base (documentation, support articles, and so on).

## Pixelagent Toolkit

If you're building agentic software, we provide an SDK for adding Pixeltable functionality to your agent's capabilities.

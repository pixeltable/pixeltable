# Working with llama.cpp in Pixeltable

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Pixeltable's built-in `llama.cpp` integration to run local LLMs efficiently.

**If you are running this tutorial in Colab:** In order to make the tutorial run a bit snappier, let's switch to a GPU-equipped instance for this Colab session. To do that, click on the `Runtime -> Change runtime type` menu item at the top, then select the `GPU` radio button and click on `Save`.

### Important Notes

* Models are automatically downloaded from Hugging Face and cached locally
* Different quantization levels are available for performance/quality tradeoffs
* Consider memory usage when choosing models and quantizations

## Set Up Environment

First, let's install Pixeltable with llama.cpp support:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  %pip install -qU pixeltable llama-cpp-python
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Create a Table for Chat Completions

Now let's create a table that will contain our inputs and responses.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  import pixeltable as pxt
  from pixeltable.functions import llama_cpp

  pxt.drop_dir('llama_demo', force=True)
  pxt.create_dir('llama_demo')

  t = pxt.create_table('llama_demo.chat', {'input': pxt.String})
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```
Connected to Pixeltable database at: postgresql+psycopg://postgres:@/pixeltable?host=/Users/asiegel/.pixeltable/pgdata
Created directory `llama_demo`.
Created table `chat`.
```

Next, we add a computed column that calls the Pixeltable `create_chat_completion` UDF, which adapts the corresponding llama.cpp API call. In our examples, we'll use pretrained models from the Hugging Face repository. llama.cpp makes it easy to do this by specifying a repo\_id (from the URL of the model) and filename from the model repo; the model will then be downloaded and cached automatically.

(If this is your first time using Pixeltable, the [Pixeltable Fundamentals](/docs/tables-and-data-operations) tutorial contains more details about table creation, computed columns, and UDFs.)

For this demo we'll use `Qwen2.5-0.5B`, a very small (0.5-billion parameter) model that still produces decent results. We'll use `Q5_K_M` (5-bit) quantization, which gives an excellent balance of quality and efficiency.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Add a computed column that uses llama.cpp for chat completion
  # against the input.

  messages = [
      {'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'},
      {'role': 'user', 'content': t.input}
  ]

  t['result'] = llama_cpp.create_chat_completion(
      messages,
      repo_id='Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF',
      repo_filename='*q5_k_m.gguf'
  )

  # Extract the output content from the JSON structure returned
  # by llama_cpp.

  t['output'] = t.result.choices[0].message.content
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```
Added 0 column values with 0 errors.
Added 0 column values with 0 errors.
```

## Test Chat Completion

Let's try a simple query:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Test with a simple question
  t.insert([
      {'input': 'What is the capital of France?'},
      {'input': 'What are some edible species of fish?'},
      {'input': 'Who are the most prominent classical composers?'}
  ])
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```

| Who are the most prominent classical composers? | The most prominent classical composers in the world are often referred to as "The Great Composers" or "The Four Great Composers" in Western classical music, and include the following composers:* Beethoven - The most famous and influential classical composer of all time, with over 2, 000 concertos, sonatas, and symphonies. Beethoven's works have influenced generations of musicians, composers, and listeners.* Bach - Another famous classical composer of the 17th and 18th centuries. His wo ...... and prolific classical composer of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His works include the opera "Don Giovanni," the symphonies, the string quartets, and the concerto "Piano Concerto No. 20."* Chopin - A Polish classical composer of the 19th century, known for his compositions of the Chopin Suite No. 1, the Ballade No. 2 in A minor, and the Waltz "Tante Marie."These composers are still celebrated today and are widely regarded as some of the greatest classical composers in history. |

## Comparing Models

Local model frameworks like `llama.cpp` make it easy to compare the output of different models. Let's try comparing the output from `Qwen` against a somewhat larger model, `Llama-3.2-1B`. As always, when we add a new computed column to our table, it's automatically evaluated against the existing table rows.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  t['result_l3'] = llama_cpp.create_chat_completion(
      messages,
      repo_id='bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF',
      repo_filename='*Q5_K_M.gguf'
  )

  t['output_l3'] = t.result_l3.choices[0].message.content

  t.select(t.input, t.output, t.output_l3).collect()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

| What is the capital of France?                  | Bonjour! Don't worry if you didn't know that already. The capital of France is actually called Paris. But just to clarify, I'd like to break it down in a way that's easy to understand.In simple terms, the capital of a country is the city where it's located. France, like many other countries, has a big city called Paris, which is its capital.If we think of it like this:- The country (France) = where it's located
- The city (Paris) = where the government, or the capital, is locatedNow, the capital is a very special city, and it's home to a lot of important buildings, museums, and places where people go to make important decisions.Does that make sense? Do you have any other questions about France or its capital?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

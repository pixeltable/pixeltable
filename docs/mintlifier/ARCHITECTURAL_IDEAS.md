# Architectural Ideas from Documentation Development

## Overview

During the development of the Mintlify documentation system, several architectural patterns and ideas emerged that extend beyond documentation into the core platform capabilities.

## 1. Hierarchical Semantic Mapping

### The Journey
- Started with flat documentation structure
- Evolved to module-first organization with visual prefixes (mod|, class|)
- Realized this mirrors how developers think about code

### The Insight
Documentation structure should reflect cognitive models, not file systems. The OPML structure becomes a **cognitive map** of the API surface.

### Application
```python
# Cognitive hierarchy in schemas
schema_hierarchy = {
    "data_ingestion": {
        "sources": ["files", "streams", "apis"],
        "transformers": ["parsers", "validators"]
    },
    "processing": {
        "compute": ["batch", "streaming"],
        "ml": ["inference", "training"]
    }
}
```

## 2. Progressive Disclosure Through Constraints

### The Pattern
1. **Repolex**: Everything possible (complete AST)
2. **OPML**: Everything documented (stable API)
3. **LLM Map**: Everything useful (common patterns)
4. **Workflows**: Everything proven (tested combinations)

### The Principle
Each layer constrains the possibility space, making it progressively easier to make correct choices.

### Implementation
```python
def generate_with_constraints(request, constraint_level):
    if constraint_level == "exploration":
        return query_repolex(request)  # All possibilities
    elif constraint_level == "development":
        return filter_by_opml(request)  # Documented only
    elif constraint_level == "production":
        return use_proven_patterns(request)  # Tested only
```

## 3. Bidirectional Documentation Flow

### Traditional
Code → Documentation → Users

### Proposed
Code ↔ Documentation ↔ Users ↔ Generated Code

### The Mechanism
- Documentation generates from code (current)
- Code generates from documentation (LLM-assisted)
- Users provide feedback that updates both

### Example
```python
# User feedback on documentation
feedback = "This function needs a batch processing mode"

# System generates
@pxt.udf
def batch_enhanced_function(data, batch_size=100):
    # Generated implementation
    pass

# Updates documentation automatically
```

## 4. Semantic Workflow Marketplace

### The Vision
Workflows become **tradeable semantic artifacts**:
- Shareable as JSON-LD
- Discoverable via SPARQL
- Composable through ontology reasoning
- Versioned with semantic meaning

### The Structure
```json
{
    "@context": "pxt:workflow",
    "@id": "wildlife-monitoring-v2",
    "extends": "wildlife-monitoring-v1",
    "improvements": [
        "better-night-vision",
        "species-classification"
    ],
    "cost": "$0.02/hour",
    "accuracy": "0.97",
    "community_rating": 4.8
}
```

## 5. Living Documentation

### The Concept
Documentation that updates itself based on:
- Actual usage patterns
- Performance metrics
- Error frequencies
- User queries

### Implementation Ideas
```python
class LivingDocumentation:
    def update_from_telemetry(self, usage_data):
        # Most used functions get better examples
        # Frequently erroring functions get warnings
        # Slow functions get performance notes
        pass
    
    def generate_examples(self, function, real_usage):
        # Create examples from actual successful uses
        pass
```

## 6. Ontology-Driven Testing

### The Idea
Use ontological relationships to generate test cases automatically:
- If A extends B, test that A maintains B's contracts
- If X produces Y, test type compatibility
- If P parallels Q, test performance equivalence

### Example
```sparql
# Generate test cases from ontology
SELECT ?test_case WHERE {
    ?func pxt:accepts ?input_type ;
          pxt:produces ?output_type .
    ?test_generator pxt:generates_for ?input_type ;
                   pxt:validates ?output_type .
}
```

## 7. Computational Cost Awareness

### The Problem
Users don't know the cost implications of their schemas until runtime.

### The Solution
Embed cost models in the ontology:
```turtle
yolox:large pxt:computationalCost [
    pxt:gpu_hours 0.1 ;
    pxt:dollar_cost 0.05 ;
    pxt:latency_ms 150
] .
```

### Usage
```python
def estimate_schema_cost(schema):
    total_cost = 0
    for column in schema.computed_columns:
        cost = query_cost_model(column.function)
        total_cost += cost * estimated_volume
    return total_cost
```

## 8. Semantic Diff for Schemas

### The Need
Understanding what changed between schema versions beyond simple field comparison.

### The Approach
```python
def semantic_diff(schema_v1, schema_v2):
    return {
        "capability_added": ["night_vision_detection"],
        "performance_impact": "+20% GPU usage",
        "accuracy_change": "+5% mAP",
        "breaking_changes": [],
        "migration_path": automatic_migration_udf
    }
```

## 9. Workflow Composition Algebra

### The Concept
Define algebraic operations on workflows:
- **Union**: Combine parallel workflows
- **Composition**: Chain workflows
- **Intersection**: Common patterns
- **Difference**: Unique capabilities

### Example
```python
# Combine two workflows
wildlife_workflow = base_video_workflow + species_detection
traffic_workflow = base_video_workflow + vehicle_tracking

# Extract common pattern
base_video_workflow = intersection(wildlife_workflow, traffic_workflow)
```

## 10. Natural Language Schema Definition

### Current State
Users write Python schemas

### Future State
Users describe intentions, system generates schemas

### The Bridge
```python
def nl_to_schema(description: str) -> dict:
    # "Monitor store shelves for out-of-stock items"
    
    # Extract entities
    entities = extract_entities(description)  # ["store", "shelves", "items"]
    
    # Map to capabilities
    capabilities = map_to_capabilities(entities)  # ["object_detection", "counting"]
    
    # Generate schema
    return generate_optimal_schema(capabilities)
```

## 11. Federated Workflow Learning

### The Opportunity
Learn from all users' workflows while preserving privacy

### The Mechanism
- Share workflow patterns, not data
- Aggregate performance metrics
- Distribute learned optimizations

### Implementation
```python
class FederatedLearning:
    def share_pattern(self, workflow):
        # Strip sensitive data
        pattern = extract_pattern(workflow)
        # Share with community
        publish_to_registry(pattern)
    
    def learn_from_community(self):
        # Download patterns
        patterns = fetch_community_patterns()
        # Integrate learnings
        update_local_knowledge(patterns)
```

## 12. Time-Travel Debugging for Workflows

### The Problem
Understanding why a workflow produced certain results

### The Solution
Complete provenance tracking with time-travel queries:
```python
# What was the state when this anomaly was detected?
state = table.at_time('2024-01-20 10:30:00')
lineage = state.trace_computation('anomaly_score')
```

## Summary

These architectural ideas form a vision where:
1. **Documentation drives development** (not just describes it)
2. **Workflows are semantic objects** (not just code)
3. **Patterns are discovered** (not just designed)
4. **Systems learn from usage** (not just execute)
5. **Users express intent** (not implementation)

The combination of Pixeltable's workflow engine, Repolex's semantic understanding, and these architectural patterns creates a platform where **building complex data pipelines becomes as simple as describing what you want to achieve**.

# Notebook Processing Prompt v002
*Enhanced with pattern recognition and cross-reference capabilities*

## MISSION
Transform Jupyter notebooks into deeply structured JSONLD files that help LLMs understand Pixeltable patterns, relationships, and production usage.

## EXTRACTION RULES v2

### Accuracy Rules
1. **EXACT CODE**: Never paraphrase or clean up code
2. **REAL OUTPUTS**: Include actual outputs (truncate smartly)
3. **PRESERVE ERRORS**: If cell has error, document it
4. **TRACK STATE**: Monitor what exists after each step

### Pattern Recognition Rules
1. **IDENTIFY REPETITION**: Mark patterns seen before
2. **TRACK FREQUENCY**: Count pattern occurrences
3. **NOTE VARIATIONS**: Document how patterns differ
4. **LINK PATTERNS**: Connect related patterns

### Relationship Rules
1. **PREREQUISITE CHAIN**: What must exist before this works
2. **DOWNSTREAM IMPACT**: What this enables
3. **CROSS-REFERENCES**: Link to related content
4. **ALTERNATIVES**: When to use different approaches

### Performance Rules
1. **MEASURE TIME**: Note execution time if >1s
2. **IDENTIFY BOTTLENECKS**: Downloads, computation, I/O
3. **SCALING FACTORS**: What affects performance
4. **OPTIMIZATION LEVEL**: Demo vs production code

### State Tracking Rules
1. **TABLES/VIEWS**: List all created/modified
2. **VARIABLES**: Track important variables
3. **MODELS**: Note downloaded/cached models
4. **DEPENDENCIES**: Track what depends on what

## QUALITY CHECKLIST v2

- [ ] GitHub URL is correct and complete?
- [ ] All code copied exactly?
- [ ] Actual outputs included (or truncated notation)?
- [ ] Patterns identified and named?
- [ ] Relationships documented?
- [ ] State tracked after each step?
- [ ] Performance noted where relevant?
- [ ] Production tips included?
- [ ] Gotchas have solutions?
- [ ] Test questions cover main concepts?
- [ ] Cookie joke is contextual? üç™

## TRUNCATION GUIDELINES

For large outputs:
```
[First 10 lines of actual output]
[... 485 lines truncated ...]
[Last 5 lines of actual output]
```

For repetitive outputs:
```
[First 3 examples]
[... 97 similar entries ...]
```

For binary/image outputs:
```
<PIL.Image.Image mode=RGB size=1280x720>
[Visual description if relevant]
```

## PATTERN MATURITY CLASSIFICATION

- **Novel**: First time seeing this pattern
- **Emerging**: Seen 2-3 times with variations  
- **Established**: Seen 4+ times, consistent form
- **Saturated**: No new variations expected

## RELATIONSHIP TYPES

- **builds_on**: Requires this concept
- **enables**: Makes this possible
- **extends**: Adds to this pattern
- **alternatives_to**: Different approach to same goal
- **combines_with**: Works well together
- **contrasts_with**: Opposite approach

## OUTPUT VALIDATION v2

Test your JSONLD:
```bash
# Check structure
jq . notebook.jsonld > /dev/null

# Find all patterns
jq '.patterns[].name' notebook.jsonld

# Track pattern frequency
jq '.patterns[] | {name, frequency}' notebook.jsonld

# Extract relationships
jq '.relationships' notebook.jsonld

# Get production tips
jq '.production_tips[]' notebook.jsonld

# Find steps by pattern
jq '.steps[] | select(.pattern_refs[] == "pattern_name")' notebook.jsonld
```

## PRIORITY ORDER v2
1. Correctness (exact code and outputs)
2. Relationships (how things connect)
3. Patterns (reusable knowledge)
4. Performance (execution characteristics)
5. Production (optimization guidance)
6. Cookies (contextual humor) üç™

## META NOTES
- After 5+ notebooks, patterns stabilize
- Cross-references become critical
- Performance patterns emerge
- Production tips accumulate
- Relationships form knowledge graph

Remember: We're building a knowledge base that improves with each notebook processed!

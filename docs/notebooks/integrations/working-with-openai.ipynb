    "Pixeltable unifies data and computation into a table interface. In the [Pixeltable Basics](https://docs.pixeltable.com/docs/pixeltable-basics) tutorial, we saw how OpenAI API calls can be incorporated into Pixeltable workflows. In this tutorial, we'll go into more depth on OpenAI integration. You'll need an OpenAI API key to run this demo.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- An OpenAI account with an API key (https://openai.com/index/openai-api/)\n",

    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- OpenAI usage may incur costs based on your OpenAI plan.\n",

    "The same day, the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America was announced.[19] The beginning of the week was marked by extreme instability in global stock markets, with dramatic drops in market values on Monday, September 15, and Wednesday, September 17.\n",
    "On September 16, the large insurer American International Group (AIG), a significant participant in the credit default swaps markets, suffered a liquidity crisis following the downgrade of its credit rating.\n",
    "The Federal Reserve, at AIG's request, and after AIG had shown that it could not find lenders willing to save it from insolvency, created a credit facility for up to US$85 billion in exchange for a 79.9% equity interest, and the right to suspend dividends to previously issued common and preferred stock.[20]'''\n",

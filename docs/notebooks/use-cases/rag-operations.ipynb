    "# RAG Operations in Pixeltable\n\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore Pixeltable's flexible handling of RAG operations on unstructured text. In a traditional AI workflow, such operations might be implemented as a Python script that runs on a periodic schedule or in response to certain events. In Pixeltable, as with everything else, they are implemented as persistent table operations that update incrementally as new data becomes available. In our tutorial workflow, we'll chunk Wikipedia articles in various ways with a document splitter, then apply several kinds of embeddings to the chunks.\n",

    "This is a good time to mention another important guiding principle of Pixeltable. The preceding examples all used the built-in `DocumentSplitter` class with various configurations. That's probably fine as a first cut or to prototype an application quickly, and it might be sufficient for some applications. But other applications might want to do more sophisticated kinds of chunking, implementing their own specialized logic or leveraging third-party tools. Pixeltable imposes no constraints on the AI or RAG operations a workflow uses: the iterator interface is highly general, and it's easy to implement new operations or adapt existing code or third-party tools into the Pixeltable workflow."

To compute our embeddings, we'll use the Huggingface `sentence_transformer` package, running it over the `chunks` view that broke our documents up into larger paragraphs. Pixeltable has a built-in `sentence_transformer` adapter, and all we have to do is add a new column that leverages it. Pixeltable takes care of the rest, applying the new column to all existing data in the view."

During that period, he created his own mixture and style of modern art, based on his ideas of Eastern European and Jewish folklore. He spent the wartime years in his native Belarus, becoming one of the country&#x27;s most distinguished artists and a member of the modernist avant-garde , founding the Vitebsk Arts College . He later worked in and near Moscow in difficult conditions during hard times in Russia following the Bolshevik Revolution , before leaving again for Paris in 1923. During World War II , he escaped occupied France to the United States, where he lived in New York City for seven years before returning to France in 1948.</td>\n",

Yet throughout these phases of his style &quot;he remained most emphatically a Jewish artist, whose work was one long dreamy reverie of life in his native village of Vitebsk.&quot; [16] &quot;When Matisse dies&quot;, Pablo Picasso remarked in the 1950s, &quot;Chagall will be the only painter left who understands what colour really is&quot;.

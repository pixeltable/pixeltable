# Pixeltable cookbook style guide

Write clear, practical how-to guides that help users solve problems with Pixeltable.

**Based on:**
- [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/) for how-to guides
- [Intuit Content Design System](https://contentdesign.intuit.com/) for tone

**Style models:**
- [calmcode.io](https://calmcode.io/) - "Code. Simply. Clearly. Calmly."
- [Python Developer Tooling Handbook](https://pydevtools.com/handbook/)

---

## Quick reference

**Recipe organization:**
- `img-` prefix - Image processing (PIL operations and custom UDFs)
- `vision-` prefix - AI vision analysis (Anthropic, OpenAI)
- `workflow-` prefix - Common workflows (JSON extraction, API keys)
- `iteration/` directory - Development patterns (refining columns, testing, caching)

**Every cookbook has:**
1. Title + one-sentence description
2. **What's in this recipe:** (2-3 bullets)
3. **## Problem** (user's situation)
4. **## Solution**
   - **### Setup** (pip + imports + API keys)
   - **### Task subsections**
5. **## Explanation** (optional)
6. **## See also** (2-3 bullets + attribution)

**Tone:**
- Direct, not chatty
- Problem-first, not tool-first
- Frame as normal workflows, not error recovery
- No "we" or "let's"
- Assume developer competence

## Validation script

Use this script to audit all cookbooks for style guide compliance:

```python
# Save as: docs/cookbook/audit_recipes.py
import json
import re
from pathlib import Path

def audit_notebook(nb_path):
    """Audit a notebook against style guide requirements."""
    with open(nb_path, 'r') as f:
        nb = json.load(f)
    
    issues = []
    sections = []
    see_also_bullets = 0
    has_problem = False
    has_solution = False
    in_problem_section = False
    
    for cell in nb['cells']:
        if cell['cell_type'] == 'markdown':

            if in_problem_section and 'pixeltable' in content.lower():
                clean_content = re.sub(r'```[\s\S]*?```', '', content)
                clean_content = re.sub(r'`[^`]+`', '', clean_content)
                if 'pixeltable' in clean_content.lower():
                    issues.append("Pixeltable in Problem section (outside code)")
            
            # Check for banned section names
            banned = ['## Overview', '## What you', '## Next steps', '## Learn more']
            for banned_name in banned:
                if banned_name in content:
                    issues.append(f"Banned section: {banned_name}")
    
    # Validate required sections
    if not has_problem:
        issues.append("Missing '## Problem' section")
    if not has_solution:
        issues.append("Missing '## Solution' section")
    
    # Check section order
    if 'Problem' in sections and 'Solution' in sections:
        prob_idx = sections.index('Problem')
        sol_idx = sections.index('Solution')
        if sol_idx < prob_idx:
            issues.append("Solution before Problem")
    
    # Check See also bullets
    if 'See also' in sections and see_also_bullets > 3:
        issues.append(f"See also has {see_also_bullets} bullets (max 3)")
    
    return issues, sections

# Run audit
all_results = {}

# Check recipes in current directory (prefixed) and subdirectories
for nb_file in Path('.').glob('*.ipynb'):
    issues, sections = audit_notebook(nb_file)
    all_results[str(nb_file)] = {'issues': issues, 'sections': sections}

# Check iteration subdirectory
iteration_dir = Path('iteration')
if iteration_dir.exists():
    for nb_file in iteration_dir.glob('*.ipynb'):
        issues, sections = audit_notebook(nb_file)
        all_results[str(nb_file)] = {'issues': issues, 'sections': sections}

# Print report
total_recipes = len(all_results)
clean_recipes = sum(1 for r in all_results.values() if not r['issues'])

for recipe, data in sorted(all_results.items()):

        for issue in data['issues']:
            print(f"   ⚠️  {issue}")

print(f"\n{clean_recipes}/{total_recipes} recipes pass all checks")
```

**Checks:**
- ✅ Has `## Problem` and `## Solution` sections
- ✅ Problem comes before Solution
- ✅ No Pixeltable mentions in Problem (except in code blocks/error messages)
- ✅ No banned section names (Overview, What you, Next steps, Learn more)
- ✅ See also has ≤ 3 bullets

---

## Problem-first, not tool-first

Users arrive with a problem, not a desire to learn Pixeltable. Show them the solution.

**Good titles:**
- "Analyze images with custom prompts"
- "Extract clean data from JSON responses"
- "Set up API keys for AI services"

**Bad titles:**
- "Using Pixeltable's vision integration"
- "Working with computed columns"
- "Fix Pixeltable errors"

**Frame as normal workflows:**
- ✓ "Iterate on your data pipeline" (development is iterative)
- ✗ "Fix incorrect computed columns" (sounds like error recovery)
- "Configure API keys" (tool-focused)

**Good intro:**
> AI services require API keys. You need a way to provide them without hardcoding credentials.

**Bad intro:**
> Here's how Pixeltable discovers credentials and manages API keys for you.

---

## Tone: Direct and respectful

**Assume developer competence:**
- No security lectures
- No cost warnings
- No condescending language
- Trust developers know their domain

**Be direct:**
- ✓ "You need API keys. Your Python runtime needs to find them."
- ✗ "You need to use API keys to access AI services, but hardcoding them is a security disaster that could cost thousands."

**No "we" or "let's", always use active voice:**
- ✓ "You examine the response structure"
- ✓ "The function extracts the response"
- ✗ "Let's check out the response"
- ✗ "We extract the response"
- ✗ "The response is extracted" (passive - "by monkeys" passes)

**Always use active voice:**

Use the "by monkeys" test from [Sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/by-monkeys): add "by monkeys" to the end of a sentence. If it still makes sense, it's passive—fix it.

✓ Active (good):
- "The function converts the image to RGBA"
- "The UDF extracts the alpha channel"
- "You define a custom function"

✗ Passive (bad):
- "The image is converted to RGBA" → "...by monkeys" ✓ = passive
- "The overlay is created..." → "...by monkeys" ✓ = passive

**Acceptable passive for emphasis:**
- "Nothing is stored in your table" - emphasizes safety/state

**Speak directly:**
- Use "you" to address the reader
- Be prescriptive, not descriptive
- Give clear guidance

**When multiple Pixeltable approaches exist:**
Don't just list options - tell users exactly when to use each one.

✓ Good:
```markdown
### Option 1: Config file

**Use when:** Local development, credentials for all projects

Create `~/.pixeltable/config.toml`:
...
```

✗ Bad:
```markdown
Here are 3 ways to configure API keys:
1. Config file
2. Environment variables
3. Getpass

Choose the one that works for you.
```

---

## Language and readability

Follow [plain language guidelines](https://digital.gov/guides/plain-language) to make content clear and accessible.

**Target reading level:** Grade 8-10

**Principles:**
- Use short, simple sentences
- Limit use of "and", "or", and commas in a sentence
- Avoid adverbs where possible
- Use conversational, natural writing style
- Avoid unnecessary jargon or complex terms

**Spell out acronyms on first use:**
- ✓ "User-Defined Function (UDF)" then later "Define a UDF..."
- ✓ "Python Imaging Library (PIL)" then later "PIL operations"
- ✗ "Use a UDF to..." (without defining it first)

**Use gender-neutral pronouns:**
- ✓ "The developer defines their function"
- ✓ "Users can customize their workflow"
- ✗ "The developer defines his function"

---

## Structure

### Title and intro

**Title:** What the user needs to accomplish (not the tool)
- "Batch process images with a common prompt"
- "Convert color images to grayscale"

**One-sentence description:** State the problem from user's perspective
- "Run the same AI vision prompt against multiple images automatically."
- "Transform RGB images to grayscale for analysis or model inputs."

**Never mention Pixeltable in the title or intro.**

### What's in this recipe

**2-3 bullets, action-focused:**
```markdown
**What's in this recipe:**
- Apply one prompt to an entire column of images
- Insert images in batch and get all results at once
- No loops or manual API calls
```

Not:
- ✗ "Learn how to..."
- ✗ "Understand the concepts of..."
- ✗ "Master the technique of..."

### Problem section

Describe the user's situation. No Pixeltable, no solutions yet.

```markdown
## Problem

You have multiple images that need the same analysis—like "Is this product damaged?", "Write a haiku", or "What's the dominant color?".

| Image | Prompt | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| sunset.jpg | "Write a haiku" | *Golden rays descend...* |
| mountains.jpg | "Write a haiku" | *Ancient stones stand tall...* |
```

**Not:**
- ✗ Security lectures
- ✗ "Why this matters" paragraphs
- ✗ Pixeltable explanations

### Solution section

**Voice and audience:**

Always address the reader using second person ("you") in active voice. Use the "by monkeys" test to catch passive constructions. Never use imperative without subject, third-person passive, or "we"/"let's".

✓ Good:
- "You apply filters using custom UDFs"
- "This gives you control over parameters"
- "You can iterate on transformations"

✗ Bad:
- "Apply filters" (imperative, no subject)
- "Filters are applied" (passive - "by monkeys" passes)
- "Uses custom UDFs" (no subject)
- "We define" (first person plural)

Match Problem statement style:
- Problem: "You need to..." 
- Solution: "You apply... This gives you..."

**Structure:**

```markdown
## Solution

**What's in this recipe:**
- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]
- [Capability 3]

You [verb] [object] using [approach]. [Dependency if needed]. This gives you [benefit].

You can iterate on transformations before adding them to your table. Use `.select()` with `.collect()` to preview results on sample images—nothing is stored in your table. If you want to collect only the first few rows, use `.head(n)` instead of `.collect()`. Once you're satisfied, use `.add_computed_column()` to apply [transformation] to all images in your table.

For more on this workflow, see [Get fast feedback on transformations](./dev-iterative-workflow.ipynb).
```

**Then Setup subsection:**

```markdown
### Setup
```

Contains ONLY environment prerequisites in code cells:
- Package installation (`%pip install -qU pixeltable ...`)
- All imports
- API key configuration (if needed)

✓ Good:
```python
# Cell 1: Install
%pip install -qU pixeltable

# Cell 2: Import
import pixeltable as pxt
from PIL import Image
```

✗ Bad:
```python
# Cell 1: Everything mixed together
import pixeltable as pxt
pxt.drop_dir('demo', force=True)  # ❌ Not setup—this is data loading
pxt.create_dir('demo')  # ❌ Not setup—this is data loading
t = pxt.create_table('demo.images', {'image': pxt.Image})  # ❌ Not setup
t.insert([...])
```

**Separate data operations from setup:**

Directory creation, table creation, and data insertion go in their own section after Setup (e.g., "### Load images" or "### Create sample data"). 

Always structure data loading sections in this order:
1. `pxt.drop_dir()` (if needed for fresh start)
2. `pxt.create_dir()`
3. `pxt.create_table()`
4. `t.insert()`

✓ Good:
```markdown
### Setup
```
```python
%pip install -qU pixeltable
```
```python
import pixeltable as pxt
```

```markdown
### Load images
```
```python
# Create a fresh directory (drop existing if present)
pxt.drop_dir('image_demo', force=True)
pxt.create_dir('image_demo')
```
```python
t = pxt.create_table('image_demo.photos', {'image': pxt.Image})
t.insert([
    {'image': 'https://example.com/photo1.jpg'},
    {'image': 'https://example.com/photo2.jpg'},
])
```

**Then task subsections:**

```markdown
### Load images

### Basic image properties

### Resize images
```

Use `###` for all subsections under Solution.

**Subsection headings describe user goals:**
- ✓ "Analyze each image with its specific prompt"
- ✗ "Create a computed column with anthropic.messages"

**Every solution must use the Query-then-Commit pattern:**

All recipes follow this workflow:

1. **DEFINE** - List functions (built-in PIL methods OR custom UDFs)
2. **QUERY** - Use `.select()` with `.collect()` to preview results. Use `.head(n)` to collect only the first n rows.
3. **COMMIT** - Use `.add_computed_column()` to save results (same expression)

This pattern applies to:
- Built-in Pixeltable functions (resize, rotate, convert)
- PIL methods on image columns
- Custom UDFs (watermarks, filters, enhancements)

**Name the pattern:** "Query-then-Commit"

### With built-in functions

✓ Good:
```markdown
### Built-in function for resizing

- `.resize(width, height)` - Change image dimensions

### Test resize with a query

Use `.select()` with `.collect()` to preview results. If you want to collect only the first few rows, use `.head(n)` instead of `.collect()`.
```

Code cells:
```python
# Cell 1: Query - preview results
t.select(t.image, t.image.resize((224, 224))).head(1)
```

```markdown
### Commit changes with a computed column
```

```python
# Cell 2: Commit - save as computed column
t.add_computed_column(resized=t.image.resize((224, 224)))
t.select(t.resized, t.resized.height, t.resized.width).show()
```

### With custom UDFs

✓ Good:
```markdown
### Define function to add watermarks

Defining a UDF makes our code easier to iterate on and easier to reuse in production when we commit to a transformation.
```

Code cells:
```python
# Cell 1: Define UDF
@pxt.udf
def add_watermark(img: Image.Image, text: str) -> Image.Image:
    ...
```

```markdown
### Test watermarks with a query

Use `.select()` with `.collect()` to preview results. If you want to collect only the first few rows, use `.head(n)` instead of `.collect()`.
```

```python
# Cell 2: Query - test on sample
t.select(t.image, add_watermark(t.image, '© 2024')).head(1)
```

```markdown
### Commit changes with a computed column
```

```python
# Cell 3: Commit - apply to all
t.add_computed_column(watermarked=add_watermark(t.image, '© 2024'))
t.select(t.image, t.watermarked).show()
```

**Heading format:**

For built-in functions:
- `### Built-in function(s) for [operation]` - singular or plural depending on count
- List methods with brief descriptions in bullets

For custom UDFs:
- `### Define function(s) to [operation]` - singular or plural depending on count
- Include the standard explanation: "Defining a UDF makes our code easier to iterate on and easier to reuse in production when we commit to a transformation."

For query and commit steps (both built-in and UDF):
- `### Test [operation] with a query` - describe the operation being tested
- `### Commit changes with a computed column` - always the same heading
- Include the standard note: "Use `.select()` with `.collect()` to preview results. If you want to collect only the first few rows, use `.head(n)` instead of `.collect()`."

**When to use `.head(n)` vs `.collect()`:**

You must use `.collect()` to execute the query and return results. `.head(n)` is a convenience method that collects only the first n rows.

Use `.head(n)` to collect a limited number of rows when:
- Testing expensive operations (API calls, model inference)
- Previewing transformations before processing full dataset
- Working with large result sets

For fast operations (resize, rotate, convert), `.head(1)` helps you preview one result quickly before committing.

**Key points:**
- Same expression in query and commit steps
- Query step shows users what will happen before running on all data
- Commit step saves results for reuse
- Consistent headings make recipes easy to scan and compare
- This reinforces the fast-feedback pattern from `iter-fast-feedback-loops.ipynb`

### Explanation section (optional)

Only include if you need to explain:
- Trade-offs between approaches
- How discovery/lookup works
- Why certain patterns matter

Most cookbooks skip this.

**Voice in Explanation sections:**

Use active voice when describing code behavior. Apply the "by monkeys" test.

✓ Active:
- "The UDF **converts** the image to RGBA"
- "The function **extracts** the alpha channel"

✗ Passive:
- "The image is converted" → "by monkeys" ✓ = passive
- "We extract the alpha channel" (first person plural)

When addressing the reader:
- ✓ "You can customize..."
- ✓ "Whether you're processing..."
- ✗ "One can customize" (too formal)

**Keep it brief:**
```markdown
## Explanation

**Discovery order:**
1. Environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
2. Config file `~/.pixeltable/config.toml`
3. Raises error if not found

**Config file is global** (all projects on your machine)
**Getpass is per-session** (better for project-specific notebooks)
```

### See also section

**2-3 related cookbooks + attribution:**

```markdown
## See also

- [Analyze images with custom prompts](./vision-custom-prompts.ipynb)
- [Extract structured data from images](./vision-structured-output.ipynb)
- *Adapted from [Anthropic's vision cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks)*
```

Maximum 3 bullets total.

---

## Formatting

### Headings

**Use sentence case:**
- ✓ "What you've built"
- ✓ "Insert images in batch"
- ✗ "What You've Built"
- ✗ "Insert Images In Batch"

**Be descriptive and action-oriented:**
- ✓ "Extract specific fields from JSON responses"
- ✗ "JSON"

### Lists

**Numbered lists** when order matters (steps in a process)
**Bulleted lists** when order doesn't matter (features, benefits)

### Code cells and comments

**Separate `.collect()` and `.show()` calls:**

Always put `.collect()` or `.show()` in its own code cell with a helpful comment describing what you're viewing.

✓ Good:
```python
# Cell 1: Add computed column
t.add_computed_column(grayscale=t.image.convert('L'))
```

```python
# Cell 2: View results
# Compare original and grayscale images
t.collect()
```

✗ Bad:
```python
# Combined in one cell
t.add_computed_column(grayscale=t.image.convert('L'))
t.collect()  # No helpful comment
```

**Separate table operations into distinct cells:**

Keep `create_table` and `insert` in separate cells for clarity and better notebook flow. This applies to all data operations - each operation should have its own cell to show its individual output.

✓ Good:
```python
# Cell 1: Create table
t = pxt.create_table('demo.images', {'image': pxt.Image})
```

```python
# Cell 2: Insert data
t.insert([
    {'image': 'url1.jpg'},
    {'image': 'url2.jpg'},
])
```

✗ Bad:
```python
# Everything in one cell
t = pxt.create_table('demo.images', {'image': pxt.Image})
t.insert([{'image': 'url1.jpg'}])
```

**Why separate cells:**
- Each operation has its own output (creation confirmation, insertion stats, column addition stats, query results)
- Easier to re-run individual operations during development
- Clearer narrative flow in notebooks
- Better cell-level comments explaining each step

**Explain **why**, not just what:

```python
# Good: explains reasoning
t.add_computed_column(
    # Use haiku model for concise responses
    response=anthropic.messages(
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': t.prompt}],
        model='claude-3-haiku-20240307'
    )
)

# Bad: just describes what the code does
t.add_computed_column(
    # Add a computed column with anthropic.messages
    response=anthropic.messages(...)
)
```

**Never add emojis** unless user explicitly requests them.

### Delivering bad news or limitations

Inspired by [Intuit's bad news guidelines](https://contentdesign.intuit.com/talking-to-customers/bad-news/):

**Deliver upfront:**
- ✓ "Drop operations cannot be undone—data is permanently deleted."
- ✗ "Well, there's this thing you should know... it might be important..."

**Focus on the solution:**
- ✓ "Use `if_exists='replace'` to fix incorrect columns."
- ✗ "You can't just drop columns because they have dependents and..."

**Stay calm, not alarmist:**
- ✓ "Drop operations cannot be undone"
- ✗ "WARNING! DANGEROUS! This will destroy everything!"
- ✗ "This is a disaster waiting to happen"

**Keep language positive:**
Focus on what users CAN do, not what they can't:
- ✓ "Use `if_exists='replace'` to update columns"
- ✗ "You can't drop columns without..."

**Don't detail the problem:**
- ✓ "Drop operations cannot be undone. Use `if_exists='replace'` instead."
- ✗ "The issue here is that Pixeltable's internal implementation doesn't track history and there's no undo mechanism because..."

## Code patterns

### Show Pixeltable patterns

**Use batch operations:**
```python
# Good
t.insert([{'image': url1}, {'image': url2}, {'image': url3}])

# Avoid
for url in urls:
    t.insert([{'image': url}])
```

**Display results with `.show()`:**
```python
# Good
t.select(t.image, t.response).show()

# Avoid
for row in t.select(t.image, t.response):
    print(row)
```

### Use the correct API

**`add_computed_column()` for computed columns:**
```python
# Correct
t.add_computed_column(response=anthropic.messages(...))

# Wrong
t.add_column(response=anthropic.messages(...))
```

`add_column()` is for ordinary (non-computed) columns with just a type.

## For LLMs

This guide uses consistent patterns. Look for "✓" and "✗" examples.

**Validation snippets:**

Check heading format:
```python
import re
def check_heading_case(heading):
    # Should be "Word word word" not "Word Word Word"
    words = heading.split()
    proper_nouns = ['Pixeltable', 'JSON', 'API', 'RGB', 'PIL', 'UDF']
    return words[0][0].isupper() and all(
        w[0].isupper() if w in proper_nouns else w[0].islower()
        for w in words[1:]
    )
```

Check for banned sections:
```python
banned = ['Overview', 'What you\'ve built', 'Next steps', 
          'What you\'ll learn', 'Summary', 'Conclusion']
```

---

**Quick transformation functions:**

Fix heading case:
```python
def fix_heading_case(heading):
    proper_nouns = ['Pixeltable', 'JSON', 'API', 'RGB', 'PIL', 'UDF']
    words = heading.split()

## Welcome to the Pixeltable Cookbook

This **cookbook** provides quick recipes for common Pixeltable tasks. 

Each recipe tackles a specific problem with a solution you can apply to your own project, and includes a discussion of how and why the recipe works. When you need deeper explanation, the cookbook will point you to the relevant User Guide sections.

    "- Test transformations on sample rows before applying to your full dataset\n",
    "- Save expressions as variables to guarantee consistent logic\n",
    "- Apply the iterate-then-add workflow with built-in functions, expressions, and custom UDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "You test transformation logic on sample rows before processing your entire dataset using the iterate-then-add workflow. This lets you validate logic on a few rows before committing to your full table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use `.select()` with `.collect()` to preview transformations—nothing is stored in your table. If you want to collect only the first few rows, use `.head(n)` instead of `.collect()`. Once you're satisfied with the results, use `.add_computed_column()` with the same expression to persist the transformation across your full table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow applies to any data type in Pixeltable: images, videos, audio files, documents, and structured tabular data. This recipe uses text data and shows three examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Testing built-in functions on sample data\n",
    "2. Saving expressions as variables to ensure consistency\n",
    "3. Iterating with custom user-defined functions (UDFs)\n"

    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the iterate-then-add workflow works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries and computed columns serve different purposes. Queries let you test transformations on sample rows without storing anything. Once you're satisfied with the results, you use the exact same expression with `.add_computed_column()` to persist it across your entire table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow is especially valuable for expensive operations—API calls, model inference, complex image processing—where you want to validate logic before processing your full dataset. Test on 2-3 rows to catch errors early, then commit once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To customize this workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample size**: Use `.head(n)` to collect only the first n rows—`.head(1)` for single-row testing, `.head(10)` for broader validation, or `.collect()` to collect all rows\n",
    "- **Save expressions**: Store transformations as variables (Example 2) to guarantee identical logic in both iterate and add steps\n",
    "- **Chain transformations**: Test multiple operations together—`.select(t.text.upper().split())` works just like single operations\n",
    "- **Use with any data type**: This pattern works with images, videos, audio, documents—not just text. For multimodal data, visual inspection during iteration is especially valuable\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Pixeltable workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional databases, `.select()` just picks which columns to view. In Pixeltable, `.select()` also lets you compute new transformations on the fly—define new columns without storing them. This makes `.select()` perfect for testing transformations before you commit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `.select()`, you're creating a query. Queries are temporary operations that retrieve and transform data from tables—they don't store anything. Queries use lazy evaluation, meaning they don't execute until you call `.collect()`. You must use `.collect()` to execute the query and return results. `.head(n)` is a convenience method that collects only the first n rows instead of all rows. Use `.head(n)` when iterating to get fast feedback without processing your entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing is stored in your table when you run queries. You can test different approaches quickly without affecting your data. You can store query results in a Python variable to work with them in your session.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Store query results as a variable (in memory only)\n",
    "results = t.select(\n",
    "    t.text,\n",
    "    uppercase=t.text.upper()  # Label the transformed column\n",
    ").head(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These results are stored in memory and will not persist across sessions—only `.add_computed_column()` persists data to your table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're satisfied, `.add_computed_column()` uses the same expression but adds it as a persistent column in your table. Now the transformation runs on all rows and results are stored permanently.\n"

<td>What are the most popular services for LLM inference?</td>
<td>LLM (Large Language Model) inference is a complex process that
involves generating human-like text using artificial intelligence
models. The most popular services and technologies used in this field
include: 1. **Hugging Face**: Hugging Face, an open-source platform,
provides several APIs and libraries for building LLMs. Some of the most
commonly used ones are: - `transformers` (for natural language
processing) - `torchtext` (for text generation) - `t5` (for T5 models) -
`pytorc ...... based on user input. These services are popular because
they provide flexibility, speed, and ease of use for developers who want
to work with large language models. The choice of service depends on the
specific requirements of your project, including the type of data you're
working with, the level of customization you need, and whether you
prefer a more lightweight or more powerful solution. If you have any
questions about these services or if you need help choosing one, feel
free to ask!</td>

# Working with Ollama in Pixeltable

Ollama is a popular platform for local serving of LLMs. In this
tutorial, we’ll show how to integrate Ollama models into a Pixeltable
workflow.

## Install Ollama

You’ll need to have an Ollama server instance to query. There are
several ways to do this.

### Running on a Local Machine

-   If you’re running this notebook on your own machine, running
    Windows, Mac OS, or Linux, you can install Ollama at:
    [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)

### Running on Google Colab

-   OR, if you’re running on Colab, you can install Ollama by
    uncommenting and running the following code.


```python
# To install Ollama on colab, uncomment and run the following
# three lines (this will also work on a local Linux machine
# if you don't already have Ollama installed).

# !curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
# import subprocess
# ollama_process = subprocess.Popen(['ollama', 'serve'], stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
```

### Running on a remote Ollama server

-   OR, if you have access to an Ollama server running remotely, you can
    uncomment and run the following line, replacing the default URL with
    the URL of your remote Ollama instance.


```python
# To run the notebook against an instance of Ollama running on a
# remote server, uncomment the following line and specify the URL.

# os.environs['OLLAMA_HOST'] = 'https://127.0.0.1:11434'
```

Once you’ve completed the installation, run the following commands to
verify that it’s been successfully installed. This may result in an LLM
being downloaded, so it may take some time.


```python
%pip install -qU ollama
```


```python
import ollama

ollama.pull('qwen2.5:0.5b')
ollama.generate('qwen2.5:0.5b', 'What is the capital of Missouri?')['response']
```

``` text
"The capital city of Missouri is Jefferson City. It's located in the central part of the state and serves as the administrative center for the Midwestern U.S. territory of Missouri. The state is known for its rich history, particularly regarding the Missouri River, which runs through its central parts and provides access to major cities along the border with Illinois."
```

## Install Pixeltable

Now, let’s install Pixeltable and create a table for the demo.


```python
%pip install -qU pixeltable
```


```python
import pixeltable as pxt
from pixeltable.functions.ollama import chat

pxt.drop_dir('ollama_demo', force=True)
pxt.create_dir('ollama_demo')
t = pxt.create_table('ollama_demo.chat', {'input': pxt.String})

messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': t.input}]

t.add_computed_column(output=chat(
    messages=messages,
    model='qwen2.5:0.5b',
    # These parameters are optional and can be used to tune model behavior:
    options={'max_tokens': 300, 'top_p': 0.9, 'temperature': 0.5},
))

# Extract the response content into a separate column

t.add_computed_column(response=t.output.message.content)
```

``` text
Connected to Pixeltable database at: postgresql+psycopg://postgres:@/pixeltable?host=/Users/asiegel/.pixeltable/pgdata
Created directory `ollama_demo`.
Created table `chat`.
Added 0 column values with 0 errors.
Added 0 column values with 0 errors.
```

We can insert our input prompts into the table now. As always,
Pixeltable automatically updates the computed columns by calling the
relevant Ollama endpoint.


```python
# Start a conversation
t.insert(input='What are the most popular services for LLM inference?')
t.select(t.input, t.response).show()
```

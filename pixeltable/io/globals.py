    """
    Creates a new Label Studio project and links it to the specified `Table`.

    The required parameter `label_config` specifies the Label Studio project configuration,
    in XML format, as described in the Label Studio documentation. The linked project will
    have one column for each data field in the configuration; for example, if the
    configuration has an entry
    ```
    <Image name="image_obj" value="$image"/>
    ```
    then the linked project will have a column named `image`. In addition, the linked project
    will always have a JSON-typed column `annotations` representing the output.

    By default, Pixeltable will link each of these columns to a column of the specified `Table`
    with the same name. If any of the data fields are missing, an exception will be raised. If
    the `annotations` column is missing, it will be created. The default names can be overridden
    by specifying an optional `col_mapping`, with Pixeltable column names as keys and Label
    Studio field names as values. In all cases, the Pixeltable columns must have types that are
    consistent with their corresponding Label Studio fields; otherwise, an exception will be raised.

    The API key and URL for a valid Label Studio server must be specified in Pixeltable config. Either:

    * Set the `LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY` and `LABEL_STUDIO_URL` environment variables; or
    * Specify `api_key` and `url` fields in the `label-studio` section of `$PIXELTABLE_HOME/config.yaml`.

    Args:
        t: The Table to link to.
        label_config: The Label Studio project configuration, in XML format.
        name: An optional name for the new project in Pixeltable. If specified, must be a valid
            Pixeltable identifier and must not be the name of any other external data store
            linked to `t`. If not specified, a default name will be used of the form
            `ls_project_0`, `ls_project_1`, etc.
        title: An optional title for the Label Studio project. This is the title that annotators
            will see inside Label Studio. Unlike `name`, it does not need to be an identifier and
            does not need to be unique. If not specified, the table name `t.get_name()` will be used.
        media_import_method: The method to use when transferring media files to Label Studio:
            - `post`: Media will be sent to Label Studio via HTTP post. This should generally only be used for
                prototyping; due to restrictions in Label Studio, it can only be used with projects that have
                just one data field, and does not scale well.
            - `file`: Media will be sent to Label Studio as a file on the local filesystem. This method can be
                used if Pixeltable and Label Studio are running on the same host.
            - `url`: Media will be sent to Label Studio as externally accessible URLs. This method cannot be
                used with local media files or with media generated by computed columns.
            The default is `post`.
        col_mapping: An optional mapping of local column names to Label Studio fields.
        sync_immediately: If `True`, immediately perform an initial synchronization by
            exporting all rows of the `Table` as Label Studio tasks.
        kwargs: Additional keyword arguments are passed to the `start_project` method in the Label
            Studio SDK, as described here:
            https://labelstud.io/sdk/project.html#label_studio_sdk.project.Project.start_project
